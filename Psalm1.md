## Annotated Text

Blessed is <r>the man  
who</r> **walks not in the counsel of <w>the wicked</w>,**  
nor **stands in the way of <w>sinners</w>,**  
nor **sits in the seat of <w>scoffers</w>;**  
but <r>his</r> **delight is in the law of <g>YWHW</g>,**  
and on <g>his</g> law <r>he</r> meditates day and night,

*<r>He</r> is like a tree  
planted by streams of water  
that yields its fruit in its season,  
and its leaf does not wither.  
In all that <r>he</r> does, <r>he</r> prospers.  
<w>The wicked</w> are not so,  
but are like chaff that the wind drives away.*

Therefore <w>the wicked</w> will not **stand in the judgement,  
nor <w>sinners</w> in the congregation of the <r>righteous</r>;**  
for <g>YHWH</g> knows the way of the <r>righteous</r>,  
but the way of the <w>wicked</w> will perish.
