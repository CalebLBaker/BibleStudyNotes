## Annotated Text

<pa>Paul, an apostle of</pa> <g>Christ Jesus</g> <pa>by the will of</pa> <g>God</g>,
and <t>Timothy our brother</t>,

To the <c>saints and faithful brothers **in</c> <g>Christ</g>** <c>at Colossae</c>:
Grace to <c>you</c> and peace from <g>God our Father</g>.

<pa>We</pa> always thank <g>God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</g>,
when <pa>we</pa> pray for <c>you</c>,
since <pa>we</pa> heard of <c>your</c> **faith in <g>Christ Jesus</g>**
and of the love that <c>you</c> have for <ch>all the saints</ch>,
because of the hope laid up for <c>you</c> in heaven.
Of this <c>you</c> have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel, which has come to <c>you</c>,
as indeed in the whole world it \[the gospel\] is bearing fruit and increasing -
as it \[the gospel\] also does among <c>you</c>, since the day <c>you</c> heard it \[the gospel\]
and understood the grace of <g>God</g> in truth,
just as <c>you</c> learned it \[the gospel\] from <e>Epaphras</e> <pa>our</pa> <e>beloved servant.
He</e> is a faithful minister of <g>Christ</g> on <c>your</c> behalf
and has made known to <pa>us</pa> <c>your</c> love **in the <g>Spirit</g>**.

And so, from the day <pa>we</pa> heard, <pa>we</pa> have not ceased to pray for <c>you</c>,
asking that <c>you</c> may be filled with the knowledge of <g>his</g> will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
so as to <u>walk in a manner worthy of the  <g>Lord</g>, fully pleasing to <g>him</g>:
bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of <g>God</g>;
being strenthened in all power, according to *<g>his</g> glorious might*,
for all endurance and patience with joy; giving thanks to the <g>Father,
who</g> has qualified <c>you</c> to share in the inheritance of the <ch>saints in light</ch></u>.
<g>He</g> has delivered <ch>us</ch> from the domain of darkness and transferred <ch>us</ch> to the *kingdom of <g>his beloved Son</g>,*
**in <g>whom</g>** <ch>we</ch> have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

*<g>He</g> is the image of <g>the invisible God</g>, the firstborn of all creation.
For by <g>him</g> all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities - all things were created through <g>him</g> and for <g>him</g>.
And <g>he</g> is before all things, and **in <g>him</g>** all things hold together.
And <g>he</g> is the head of <ch>the body, the church</ch>.
<g>He</g> is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything <g>he</g> might be preeminent.
For **in <g>him</g>** the fullness of <g>God</g> was pleased to dwell, and through <g>him</g> to reconcile to <g>himself</g> all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of <g>his</g> cross.*

And <c>you, who</c> once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,
<g>he</g> has now reconciles in <g>his</g> body of flesh by <g>his</g> death, in order to present <c>you</c> holy and blameless and above reproach before <g>him</g>,
if indeed <c>you</c> continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,
not shifting from the hope of the gospel that <c>you</c> heard, which \[the gospel\] has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which \[the gospel\] <pa>I, Paul</pa>, became a minister.
