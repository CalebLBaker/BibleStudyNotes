## Annotated Text

<pa>Paul, an apostle of</pa> <g>Christ Jesus</g> <pa>by the will of</pa> <g>God</g>,
and <t>Timothy our brother</t>,

To the <c>saints and faithful brothers **in</c> <g>Christ</g>** <c>at Colossae</c>:
Grace to <c>you</c> and peace from <g>God our Father</g>.

<pa>We</pa> always thank <g>God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</g>,
when <pa>we</pa> pray for <c>you</c>,
since <pa>we</pa> heard of <c>your</c> **faith in <g>Christ Jesus</g>**
and of the love that <c>you</c> have for <ch>all the saints</ch>,
because of the hope laid up for <c>you</c> in heaven.
Of this <c>you</c> have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel, which has come to <c>you</c>,
as indeed in the whole world it \[the gospel\] is bearing fruit and increasing -
as it \[the gospel\] also does among <c>you</c>, since the day <c>you</c> heard it \[the gospel\]
and understood the grace of <g>God</g> in truth,
just as <c>you</c> learned it \[the gospel\] from <e>Epaphras</e> <pa>our</pa> <e>beloved servant.
He</e> is a faithful minister of <g>Christ</g> on <c>your</c> behalf
and has made known to <pa>us</pa> <c>your</c> love **in the <g>Spirit</g>**.

And so, from the day <pa>we</pa> heard, <pa>we</pa> have not ceased to pray for <c>you</c>,
asking that <c>you</c> may be filled with the knowledge of <g>his</g> will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
so as to <u>walk in a manner worthy of the  <g>Lord</g>, fully pleasing to <g>him</g>:
bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of <g>God</g>;
being strenthened in all power, according to *<g>his</g> glorious might*,
for all endurance and patience with joy; giving thanks to the <g>Father</u>,
who</g> has qualified <c>you</c> to share in the inheritance of the <ch>saints in light</ch>.
<g>He</g> has delivered <ch>us</ch> from the domain of darkness and transferred <ch>us</ch> to the *kingdom of <g>his beloved Son</g>,*
**in <g>whom</g>** <ch>we</ch> have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
