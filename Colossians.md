## Annotated Text

<pa>Paul, an apostle of</pa> <g>Christ Jesus</g> <pa>by the will of</pa> <g>God</g>,
and <t>Timothy our brother</t>,

To the <c>saints and faithful brothers **in</c> <g>Christ</g>** <c>at Colossae</c>:
Grace to <c>you</c> and peace from <g>God our Father</g>.

<pa>We</pa> always thank <g>God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</g>,
when <pa>we</pa> pray for <c>you</c>,
since <pa>we</pa> heard of <c>your</c> **faith in <g>Christ Jesus</g>**
and of the love that <c>you</c> have for <ch>all the saints</ch>,
because of the hope laid up for <c>you</c> in heaven.
Of this <c>you</c> have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel, which has come to <c>you</c>,
as indeed in the whole world it \[the gospel\] is bearing fruit and increasing -
as it \[the gospel\] also does among <c>you</c>, since the day <c>you</c> heard it \[the gospel\]
and understood the grace of <g>God</g> in truth,
just as <c>you</c> learned it \[the gospel\] from <e>Epaphras</e> <pa>our</pa> <e>beloved servant.
He</e> is a faithful minister of <g>Christ</g> on <c>your</c> behalf
and has made known to <pa>us</pa> <c>your</c> love **in the <g>Spirit</g>**.

And so, from the day <pa>we</pa> heard, <pa>we</pa> have not ceased to pray for <c>you</c>,
asking that <c>you</c> may be filled with the knowledge of <g>his</g> will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
so as to <u>walk in a manner worthy of the  <g>Lord</g>, fully pleasing to <g>him</g>:
bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of <g>God</g>;
being strenthened in all power, according to *<g>his</g> glorious might*,
for all endurance and patience with joy; giving thanks to the <g>Father,
who</g> has qualified <c>you</c> to share in the inheritance of the <ch>saints in light</ch></u>.
<g>He</g> has delivered <ch>us</ch> from the domain of darkness and transferred <ch>us</ch> to the *kingdom of <g>his beloved Son</g>,*
**in <g>whom</g>** <ch>we</ch> have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

*<g>He</g> is the image of <g>the invisible God</g>, the firstborn of all creation.
For by <g>him</g> all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities - all things were created through <g>him</g> and for <g>him</g>.
And <g>he</g> is before all things, and **in <g>him</g>** all things hold together.
And <g>he</g> is the head of <ch>the body, the church</ch>.
<g>He</g> is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything <g>he</g> might be preeminent.
For **in <g>him</g>** the fullness of <g>God</g> was pleased to dwell, and through <g>him</g> to reconcile to <g>himself</g> all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of <g>his</g> cross.*

And <c>you, who</c> once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,
<g>he</g> has now reconciles in <g>his</g> body of flesh by <g>his</g> death, in order to present <c>you</c> holy and blameless and above reproach before <g>him</g>,
if indeed <c>you</c> continue in the faith, stable and steadfast,
not shifting from the hope of the gospel that <c>you</c> heard, which \[the gospel\] has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which \[the gospel\] <pa>I, Paul</pa>, became a minister.

Now <pa>I</pa> rejoice in <pa>my</pa> sufferings for <c>your</c> sake,
and in <pa>my</pa> flesh <pa>I</pa> am filling up what is lacking in <g>Christ's</g> afflictions for the sake of <c>his</c> <ch>body</ch>,
that is, <ch>the church</ch>,
of <ch>which</ch> <pa>I</pa> became a minister according to the stewardship from <g>God</g> that was given to <pa>me</pa> for <c>you</c>,
to make the word of <g>God</g> fully known,
the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to <ch>his saints</ch>.
To <ch>them</ch> <g>God</g> chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is **<g>Christ</g> in <c>you</c>,** ***the hope of glory.***
<g>Him</g> <pa>we</pa> proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that <pa>we</pa> may present everyone **mature in <g>Christ</g>.**
For this <pa>I</pa> toil, struggling with all **<g>his</g> energy that <g>he</g> powerfully works within <g>me</g>.**

For <pa>I</pa> want <c>you</c> to know how great a struggle <pa>I</pa> have for <c>you</c> and for <ch>those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen</ch> <pa>me</pa> <ch>face to face</ch>,
that <ch>their</ch> hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of <g>God's</g> mystery,
which is <g>Christ</g>, ***in <g>whom</g> are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.***
<pa>I</pa> say this in order that no one may delude <c>you</c> with plausible arguments.
For though <pa>I</pa> am absent in body, yet <pa>I</pa> am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see <c>your</c> good order and the firmness of <c>your</c> faith **in Christ.**
