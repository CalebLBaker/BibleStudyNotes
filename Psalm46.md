**<g>God</g> is <us>our</us> refuge and strenth,  
a very present help in trouble,  
Therefore <us>we</us> will not fear though** ***the earth gives way,  
though mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,  
though its \[the sea\] waters roar and foam,  
though the mountains temble at its \[the sea\] swelling.*** 

Selah

There is a river whose stream makes glad the <us>city of</us> <g>God</g>,  
the holy habitation of <g>the Most High</g>.  
**<g>God</g> is in the midst of <us>her; she</us> shall not be moved;  
<g>God</g> will help <us>her</us> when morning dawns.**  
*<n>The nations</n> rage, <n>the kingdoms</n> totter;*  
<u><g>he</g> utters <g>his</g> voice, *the earth melts.*</u>  
**<g>YHWH of hosts</g> is with <us>us</us>;  
<g>The God of Jacob</g> is <us>our</us> fortress.**

Selah

<u>Come, behold the works of <g>YHWH</g>,  
how <g>he</g> has brought *desolations on the earth*.  
<g>He</g> makes wars cease to the end of the earth;  
<g>he</g> breaks the bow and shatters the spear;  
<g>he</g> burns the chariots with fire.  
**"Be still, and know that <g>I am God</g>.**  
<g>I</g> will be exalted among <n>the nations</n>,  
<g>I</g> will be exalted in the earth!"</u>  
**<g>YHWH of hosts</g> is with <us>us</us>;
