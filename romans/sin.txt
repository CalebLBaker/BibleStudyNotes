Romans 1:18 - 3:20

Romans outline
	ROMANS:	God sovereignly saves sinners through faith and protects them with His love so that they might live to glorify Him
    	Paul wrote to the faithful Romans and desired to visit them and spread further the gospel that had changed them (1:1-15)
		The gospel (1:16 - 15:12)
			Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe (1:16, 17)
			Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
				The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
					God's wrath against those who exhange true worship for false idolatry is revealed by giving them over to further depravity (1:18-32)
						The wrath of God is revealed against unrighteous men who suppress the apparent truth of God and exchange worship for idolatry (1:18-23)
						Because men exchanged true worship of God for false idolatry, gave them over to depravity, corrupting and all areas of their life (1:24-32)
							Because men exchanged true worship of God for false idolatry, God gave them over to the degrading desires of their hearts (1:24, 25)
							Because men exchanged true worship of God for idolatry, God allowed them to exchange true sexual passions for homosexuality (1:26, 27)
							Because they did not acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind, leading to willful violation of God's commands (1:28-32)
					God's judgement is passed on those who judge the sins of others while practicing the very same thing in their own life (2:1-11)
						Those who exploit God's kindness to judge the sins of others rather than repenting will not be spared from God's judgement (2:1-5)
						God will judge each person according to their works (2:6-11)
					God's judgement is passed on the Jews who, although they have the law, do not keep it (2:12 - 3:8)
						God's judgement pays no respect to ethnicity, unapplied knowledge of the law, or physical rituals (2:12-29)
							The law is available in some form to everyone and people are justified by obeying it not by having it (2:12-16)
							God's people are those who do the law, are Jews inwardy, and have cirumcised hearts(2:17-29)
								Although the Jews relied on the law and boasted in God, they dishonored God by breaking the law (2:17-24)
								A true Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart, and so physical circumcision is of no value (2:25-29)
						God is glorified through righteously judging the Jews for being unfaithful to the law, which He gave them as a special advantage (3:1-8)
					All men have rejused to fear God, pursued wickedness, and been justly condemned by the righteous precepts of the law (3:9-20)
						All men, both Jews and Greeks, have chosen not to fear God, and therefore pursue their own wicked way (3:9-18)
						The law holds all men accountable for their sins and condemns everyone (3:19, 20)
				Salvation by faith (3:21 - 5:21)
				Sanctification - the righteous shall live by faith(6, 7)
				Security - power of God (8)
				Sovereignty - to the Jew first and also to the Greek (9-11)
			Paul describes how believers should act in response to the mercy of God - not ashamed of the gospel (12:1 - 15:12)
		Personal letter to the Romans (15:13-16:27)

1:18-23
	1:18
		Observations
			This verse explains the necessity of the gospel and why the righteous must live by faith
			This verse isolates three things as warranting God's wrath
				Lack of reverence towards God
				Injustice and violation of the law
				Suppression of the truth
					Which comes from injustice
			God has wrath
				This is the necessary response of a righteous God to sin
				God would not be righteous if He did not respond to sin with wrath
			God's wrath is revealed
				God acts upon His wrath, He's not just silently angry
				From heaven
				Against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
					God cannon leave any sin unpunished
						For those who believe and are saved
							This means that salvation is not is not the absense of punishment, but rather the redirection of punishment
						For those who do not believe
							There is no way to escape God's wrath
					None are immune
					All sin shall be punished
					Ungodliness
						Lack or reverence towards God
					Unrighteousness
						Violation of the law
						Injustice
					Who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth
						Suppress
							Hold back, detain
						They know the truth, but, by their unrighteousness, they suppress it
							They prevent the truth from influencing them and from reaching others
								They actually manage to prevent themselves from believing that which they know to be true.
							They don't want to believe that which they know to be true
								And so they try to belittle it and hide it by their own unrighteousness
		Summary
			The wrath of God is revealed against all the ungodly who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness
		Application
			No indignation at God because of trajedy is justified
				All are unrighteous and deserving of God's wrath
			Revere God
			Accept and believe the truth which God reveals about Himself
				The suppression of this truth is the end of unrighteousness and warrants God's wrath
	19, 20
		Observation
			These verses give an example of truth that men suppress in unrighteousness
			19
				What can be known about God
					There are things we can know about God
					There are things we cannot know about God
					Is plain to them, because God has shown it to them
						There is no spiritual or gnostic secret
						What God has revealed, he has made obvious
							General revelation is sufficient to require reverence of God
								But men do not give Him do reverence
						Nature and conscience both bear witness to the reality and majesty of God
			20
				His invisible attributes
					These attributes cannot be seen and yet are apparent
					Eternal power
						God is eternally all-powerful
					Divine nature
						God is, by nature, God
					Have been clearly perceived
						Ever since the creation of the world
							In the things that have been made
								Creation itself and nature reveal God
									The intricacy, scale, and beauty of creation require a divine, eternally powerful Creator
									Psalm 19:1-6
				So they are without excuse
					Everyone had a chance to repent
					The revelation of God's majesty in nature should be sufficient to cause repentence in the rebellious
					God is just in condemning those who reject Him after seeing His majesty in nature
						Even if they never saw or heard of Him through any witness besides creation itself
		Summary
			God's eternal power and divine nature are clearly by creation itself, so those who reject Him are without excuse
		Application
			Look more for how God reveals Himself through His creation
	21 - 23
		Observation
			21
				Although they knew God
					This was established in verses 19 and 20
					They did not honor Him as God
						Their actions were inconsistent with their knowledge
						Honor Him as God
							God is worthy of all honor
							All people should submit to Him in all things
							All people should ascribe all glory, honor and reverence to Him
							God deserves exclusive worship
					Or give thanks to Him
						God is the source of all good things
						It is both foolish and ungrateful not to thank Him for His blessings
							Blessings such as existence
					They became futile in their thinking
						Any philosophy or worldview which discredits God is ultimately futile and useless
						And their foolish hearts were darkened
							It is folly to refuse God the honor He is due
								The fool says in his heart, "There is no God"
									And yet God's invisible attributes are apparent, even to fools
							In their folly, they did not receive the true Light, which gives light to everyone
								They like darkness rather than light
								They desire ignorance
			22, 23
				Claiming to be wise they became fools
					They claim that seeking independence and autonomy is wise
					Any attempt at life that doesn't include complete dependence upon God is foolish and futile
				And exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images
					They were given the opportunity to worship and revere the immortal deity who deserves all glory
					Instead they chose to worship things made in the image of fallen, mortal things
						Their idols arent even alive, let alone gods
						Man
							God made man in His image and man has been trying to return the favor ever since
						Animals and creeping things
						They knew the One who made both them and that which they worshipped
							But they chose not to worship Him
								They revered the pot instead of the potter
		Summary
			Although men knew God, they rejected Him and exhanged true worship of Him for false worship of creation
		Application
			Worship God
			Don't worship idols
				This involves anything that would take a more prominent role in my life than God
			Be grateful to God
	Summary
		The wrath of God is revealed against unrighteous men who suppress the apparent truth of God and exchange worship for idolatry
1:24-32:
	1:24, 25
		Observations
			Therefore
				That which is described in this paragraph comes as a consequence of the rebellion described in the previous paragraph
			God gave them up
				In this case, the most fitting punishment for sin was sin
				Because men wickedly suppressed the truth of God and refused to worship Him, God gave them what they wanted instead of what they needed
				Lusts of their heart
					The punishment that God gave them was the very sin that they craved and lusted after
				Impurity
					Lustful and wastefully extravagent living
				Dishonoring of their bodies among themselves
					Sexual sins?
			Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie
				They had that which is true and good:	knowledge of and opportunity to worship God
				They gave it up for that which is false and wicked:	idolatry
				Worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator
					Idolatry is esteeming God's creation more than you esteem God
					Who is blessed forever
						God is not dependent upon man's worship
						God is forever blessed regardless of what else happens
		Summary
			Because men exchanged true worship of God for false idolatry, God gave them over to the lustful, sinful, degrading desires of their hearts
		Application
			Worship God
			Understand that the root of sin is in a fundamental rejection of God's truth
				Rejection of God's truth leads to idolatry
				Idolatry leads to all sorts of evils
	1:26, 27
		Observations
			Because men supressed the truth and worshipped idols rather than God:
				God allowed them to be overtaken by sinful passions
					Because mankind exchanged the truth of God for a lie, God allowed mankind to exchange natural passions for unnatural passions
						Because of their sin, God allowed humans to be consumed with perverted homosexual passions
						Homosexuality is unnatural and sinful
							It is also a consequence of rebellion against God and suppression of the truth
								Not only the act itself, but the very passions that underly the act are dishonorable
						Unnatural perversion of worship (idolatry) leads to unnatural perversion of everything, including sex (homosexuality)
			Receiving in themselves the due penalty for their errors
				They received in themselves the penalty that was appropriate for their sin
				Is this simply another statement that a just penalty for sin is more sin?
					Option 1:	Perversion of sex is the just penalty for perversion of worship
						I think it is this one
					Option 2:	Paul is implying additional negative penalties for homosexual activity
					Could be both
		Summary
			Because men exchanged true worship of God for idolatry, God allowed them to exchange true sexual passions for homosexuality
		Application
			Homosexuality is sinful and wrong
			Homosexuality, like all sins, is a symptom of idolatry
				There is no sense in treating the symtpom without treating the disease
					The greatest need of a homosexual person is to repent of their idolatry
	1:28-32
		Observations
			28
				Everything described in this paragraph is a result of men choosing not to acknowledge God
					In a sense this is describing the result of them breaking the first commandment against idolatry (Exodus 1:3)
					They had knowledge of God, but they did not acknowledge Him, as stated preveiously
				God gave them up to a debased mind
					A mind which does not prove itself to be what it should be
					This mind results in doing things which should not be done
						And will be described in the rest of this paragraph
			Things which should not be done
				29
					Filled with (have an abundance of)

						The list
							All manners of unrighteousness
								Everything that violates God's law

									Bad character or malicious craftiness
				30
					They are

											This violates the ninth commandment (Exodus 1:16)
								Slanderers
									Katalalos
										Defamer or evil speaker
											This violates the ninth commandment (Exodus 1:16)
							Haters of God
								They hate the One who made them, Whom they should love
								Their hatred of God could cause them to violate the first commandment by putting all other gods before God	(Exodus 1:3)
							They think highly of themselves
								Insolent
									Out of pride, they insult or shamefully wrong others
								Haughty
									Proud and arrogant
									They make themselves into an idol to put before God, breaking the first commandment	(Exodus 1:3)
								Boastful
									Brag about themselves
							Inventors of evil
								They are not content just to do the evil that others are doing. They invent new evil things to do

								Breaking covenants
									They don't keep their word
									This includes marital covenants
										Adultery breaks the seventh commandment	(Exodus 1:14)
							Heartless

							Ruthless
								Merciless
			32
				They know God's righteous decree
					God's decree against these wicked things is rigtheous
					Those who do these things deserve to die
				They do it anyway
					They do what they know to be wrong and what they know to warrant death
				They even approve of others doing it
					They aren't even just in it for personal pleasure or benefits
						They enjoy wickedness for the sake of wickedness
		Summary
			Because they did not acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind, leading to willful violation of God's commands in all aspects of life
		Application
			Acknowlege God
			Give praise to God continually
	Summary
		Because men exchanged true worship of God for false idolatry, gave them over to depravity, corrupting their worship, sex, and all other areas of life
2:1-5
	Observation
		1
			Therefore
				Because God's wrath is revealed against those who suppress the truth in unrighteousness
			You have no excuse, O man
				God's attributes are sufficiently revealed in creation that all should believe in Him
			Every one of you who judges
				We are now addressing those people who judge and condemn the rampant sinful practices of the world
			For in passing judgement on another, you condemn yourself
				The self-righteous who judge the sinfulness of the world indulge in that very same sinfulness themselves
		2
			It is right for God to judge those who engage in these sinful behaviors
				This was emphasised in 1:32
		3
			Hypocrates will not, by judging others for sin, be excused of their own sin
		4
			The riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience
				Although the God wrath of God is revealed against sinful practices, out of kindness He patiently endures sin for a while
				The purpose of this is to lead the sinner to repentence
				It is presumptious to act as though the purpose of God's mercy is to allow you more chance to judge others.
					God is to judge sinners. Sinners are not to judge sinners.
			The hypocrites being discussed are too busy judging the sins of others to repent of their own sins.
		5
			Because of your hard and impenitent heart
				These hypocrites' problems are the result of their refusal to repent of their own sins
			Storing up wrath
				This refusal to repent will be righteously and wrathfully judged by God
	Summary
		Those who exploit God's kindness to judge the sins of others rather than repenting of their own sins will not be spared from God's judgement
	Application
		Repent of my judgemental and self-righteous spirit
2:6-11
	Observation
		This passage sounds like works righeousness
			But even though we are not saved by good works, we are saved to good works
			If any man is in Christ he is a new creation
			The old man, who was self-seeking and disobedient to the truth is dead
				The new creation is transformed by the renewing of the mind
					The new creation can seek for glory, honor, and immortality
		Both the righteus and the unrighteous contain both Jews and Greeks
		He will render to each one according to his works
			God judges justly
			How then are any saved, since none is righteous
				See 7:17
					It is no longer I who do it, but sin that lives in me
			To those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality
				Actions
					Those who, by patiently doing what is right, work towards attaining
						Glory
							Their service towards glorifying God causes them to receive glory as well
						Honor
							They honor God and God honors them
						Immortality
							They believe God and are rewarded with eternal life
					Do good
				Consequence
					They will be given eternal life
					Glory, honor, and peace
					To the Jew first and also to the Greek
				These are believers who have been justified and sanctified by Christ
			Those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness
				Actions
					They seek their own gain and glory rather than God's
					They obey unrighteousness rather than the truth
					They do evil
				Consequence
					God's righteous judgement
						There will be wrath and fury
						Tribulation and distress
					To the Jew first and also to the Greek
						This is the first explicit statement that the Jews are not immune from God's wrath
							It has been implied many times, though
		God shows no partiality
			Both the Jews and the Greeks are judged righteously according to their works
				The Jews get no special priveleges
	Summary
		God will judge each person according to their works
	Application
		Do good
2:12-16
	12, 13
		Observation
			But be doers of the Word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves
			12
				Disobedience is punished both in those who have the law and in those who do not
				Not having the law does not excuse the Gentiles
					They shall perish without the law
				Having the law does not save the Jews
					They will be judged by the very law which they have
			13
				Hearing the law does not make one righteous before God
				Those who do the law are righteous before God
				If someone were obedient to the law they would be justified by their obedience
					But there is nobody who is obedient
				Righteousness according to the Law comes from right action, not from hearing
		Summary
			People are justified by doing the law and not by possessing it, nor are they excused by not possessing it
		Application
			Do what scripture says, don't just read it
	14 - 16
		Observation
			This passage is the reason behind verse 12
			Gentiles, without the law are accused or excused by how they heeded their consciences
			14
				Gentiles do not have the law
				Gentiles sometimes, by nature, do what is right
					At these times they are a law to themselves
						This is talking about conscience
				Gentiles' conscience act as a law to govern them even when they do not have the Law
			15, 16
				The work of the law is written on their hearts
					God has given everyone a sense of morality
				Their conscience also bears witness
					They have either heeded or ignored their conscience
				Their conflicting thoughts either accuse or excuse them
				A day of judgement will come when God judges the secrets of men by Jesus
		Summary
			God has written His law on the hearts of gentiles so that their consciences will accuse or excuse them on the day of judgement
		Application
			Share the gospel because nobody is saved without it
	Summary
		The law is available in some form to everyone and people are justified by obeying it not by having it
2:17-24
	Observation
		Paul is addressing Jews specifically now
		This whole paragraph is reminicent of Jesus' rebuke of the pharisees in Matthew 23
		17-21a
			Call yourself a Jew
				These people probably took pride in being Jewish
			Rely on the Law
				These people might think that they are righteous before God because they are hearers of the Law
				They might even think that they obey the law, but they do not
			Boast in God
				They think they are righteous before God
			18
				These people study the law
					Because of their study of the law they think that they know God's will
					They think that they rightly give approval to that which is excellent
						With the words of their mouth they might actually give approval to that which is excellent
							But their actions or attitudes speak otherwise
			19, 20
				Because they have the law they think they are superior
					And so they want to guide those who they see as more in need than themselves
						They try to be spiritual guides
							"Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."
						They try to help those who they think are not as spiritual as themselves
					They have God's law, but they do not truly understand or follow God's law and so they are not as good of guides as they think themselves to be
				They think that because they have the law, which is the embodiment of knowledge and truth
					They have spiritual sight while others are spiritually blind
					They are light while others are in darkness
					They are wise while others are foolish
					They are mature while others are children
				What they think is their role because of the Law is actually the role of believers because of the Holy Spirit
					He restores sight to the blind
					He makes us to be salt and light
					The foolishness of God is greater than the wisdom of man
					We are called to grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
				Their possession of the Law actually is and advantage because the Law points to God
					But the law alone does not bring salvation
			21
				Paul questions whether these people practice what they preach
					"so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice."
		21b
			Though they taught against stealing, they stole
		22a
			Though they taught against adultery, they committed adultery
				Not just physically, but spiritually, abandoning a true relationship with God for legalism, idolatry, or worldly pursuits
		22b
			Though they abhored idols, they robbed temples
				Deuteronomy 7:25, 26 forbids taking anything from the temple of an idol
					Anything associated with an idol should be considered to be of no value
		23
			Though they boast in the law, they break the law
				And breaking the law dishonors God
					Who they boast in according to verse 17
		24
			Because of the Jews' hypocricy, God is dishonored and blasphemed among the Gentiles
				Cited from Isaiah 52:5
					In Isaiah's time the gentiles misunderstood God's actions by mistaking discipline for weakness, and so they mocked Him
					Now they correctly understand the Jew's actions and, in light of the hypocricy the Jews show, mock the God the Jews claim to worship
			Not only do they condemn themselves by their hypocricy, they cause other to mock the God they claim to follow

		ISAIAH:	Israel rejected God in favor of idols, and so God will judge them among the rest of the nations, but He will then turn their hearts toward Him and bless them
			Although Israel sinfully follows idols, God will turn them back to Him, atone for their iniquities, and prosper them over all other nations (40 - 66)
				God will redeem Israel and bring them back to the land out from the nations where they were in exile (44:21 - 52:6)
					Gods people were sold to Assyria for nothing, but He will redeem them without money so that they shall know His name (52:3-6)
						Gentiles despise the Lord because He allows He has allowed His people to be oppressed by Assyria (52:5)

	Summary
		Although the Jews thought they did well by having and teaching the Law, they did not obey it and their hypocricy rendered their teaching worthlessi

	Application
		Words without action is hypocricy
		Claiming to follow God without actually following Him is worse than not following Him at all

2:25-29
	25-27
		Observations
			25-Circumcision is not sufficient
				Circumcision has value for those who keep the law
				Circumcision is rendered void for those who break the law
				All mankind has broken the law
					All circumcision is rendered void
						Then why did God command Abraham to be circumcised
							Because circumcision is an outward sign of the faith and the covenant that Abraham already had which were of value
			26-Circumcision is not necessary
				If an uncircumcised person keeps the law he will be counted as circumcised
				Physical circumcision is quite unnecesary
					Circumcised hearts are more important than circumcised flesh
			27
				The uncircumcised law abider will condemn the circumcised law breaker
					This probably just means that the one who keeps the law is justified while the one who is circumcised is not justified
				Those who have the written code, if they do not obey it, are no better off than those who don't
		Summary
			Circumcision is neither sufficient nor neccesary for salvation and is void for those who do not keep the law
		Application
			Trust not in physical representations of faith for salvation, but rather place your faith solely in Jesus Christ
			Like circumcision, baptism is neither neccesary nor sufficient for salvation
	28, 29
		Observations
			28
				Being physically descended from Abraham does not make someone truly a Jew
				True circumcision has nothing to do with the physical body
			29a
				A Jew is one inwardly
					God judges the heart
					God's people are those who truly love Him and seek to serve Him
				Circumcision is a matter of the heart
					Circumcision is about cutting off your sin not your foreskin
					This is done by the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit
					The law was meant to lead to sanctification
			29b
				The world does not praise those who have had their hearts circumcised
				God honors and praises those who are truly His people
		Summary
			The true people of God are determined by their hearts, not their lineage
		Application
			Seek to serve God in the Spirit rather than relying on the flesh
	Summary
		A true Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart, and so physical circumcision is of no value

3:1-8
	3:1-4
		Observations
			1
				Paul raises rhetorical questions that the audience would have been having
					If 2:17-29 is true, then what is the point of being Jewish
			2
				Paul answers the question of verse one
					There are many advantages
						The first is that they were entrusted with the scriptures
							Although the Jews could not keep the law, even knowing the law was a tremendous advantage over other people
			3a
				Paul raises an objection to the answer he gave in verse 2
					If 2:12-24 is true, then what is the point of having the Law?
						It is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers who will be justified
						How can there be advantage to being given a law they can't keep?
			3b, 4
				Paul answers the objection he gave in verse 3a.
					Does the Jews' faithlessness in keeping the law nullify God's faithfulness in giving the law?
						Of course not!
							God gave the Jews all the guidance they needed
								But they did not follow His guidance
									Because the Jews did not follow the law that God gave them, God is justified in condemning them
		Summary
			The Jews failed to act on the law, which was the chief advantage God gave them, and so God is justified to condemn them
		Application
			Humbly admit sin to God
			Accept that God is justified in condemning those who reject Him

			4b cited from Psalm 51:4
				David prayed to God, asking for forgiveness from his transgressions (Psalm 51)
					David sinned against God from the moment he was born (3-6)
						David's sin was principally directed against God and so God is justified to condemn him (4)
	3:5-8
		Obserations
			5
				Paul raises a rhetorical question that the audience would have been asking
					If our unrighteousness shows God's righteousness (as implied by verse 4), why are we condemned for being unrighteous
					Paul makes it clear that he doesn't give this objection much weight
						(I speak in a human way)
					This objection must be false since its end is accusing God of unrighteousness
			6
				Paul answers the objection of verse 5
					Of course not!
					If condemning unrighteousness was unrighteous God could not righteously judge the world
						This contradicts God's nature as the Righteous Judge
			7, 8
				Paul extends the objection of verse 5 to its logical end
					Through my lie, God's truth abounds							(true)
					The abundant revelation of God's truth bring Him glory		(true)
					I should not be condemned for being a sinner				(false)
						None of creation has a right to deny God
						To deny Him anyway is wicked
						God will judge the wicked
					I should do evil so that good might come					(false)
						You are a slave to that which you obey
						It is not good to be a slave to disobedience
						One cannot be a slave to two masters
				Some people accused Paul and those with him as taking this line of reasoning
					This is pure slander. Paul dismisses this line of reasoning as completely out of hand
					Those who attach this opinion to the apostles are justly condemned
						They do not see fit to acknowledge God and have been given over to a debased mind so that they are gossips, slanderers, haters of God ...
			Two main questions are raised here
				If God's justice is ultimately revealed through me sinning, how can he condemn me for sinning?
					Paul's answer here:
						Then how could God judge the earth?
					Paul's answer to a similar question in chapter 9:
						Who are you to answer back to God?
				If good comes from us doing evil, shouldn't we keep doing evil so that good may come?
					Paul's answer here:
						No
					Paul's answer to a similar question in chapter 6:
						How can we who have died to sin still live to it?
						You are a slave to that which you obey
							If you are obedient to sin, then you are a slave to sin
								That leads to death
							You cannot be a slave to both sin and to Christ
		Summary
			Some accuse the apostles of advocating doing evil so that good may come, but Paul condemns this view as completely wrong
	Summary
		God is glorified through righteously judging the Jews for being unfaithful to the law, which He gave them as a special advantage
3:9-12
	Observations
		9
			Paul once again assumes the persona of the questioner from verse 5 to ask another question
				If us Jews have the advantage of the law as said in verse 2 but are judged for neglecting it as stated in verses 3-8, are we really any better off?
			Paul answers the question:
				Not at all.
				Jews and Gentiles are both alike under sin and deserving of God's wrath, as established in 2:12-16
		10-12
			paraphrased from Psalm 14:1-3
				10
					Nobody is righteous. Nobody.
				11
					No one understands
						The Gentiles do not understand the testimony concerning God given to them by nature
						The Jews do not understand the law which they study
						If anyone did understand the witness given to them, they would turn to Him and be healed
					No one seeks for God
						If anyone did seek Him, they would find Him
						Instead, God seeks us
							"The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost"
				12
					Everyone has turned aside from following God
						They had a chance to follow Him, as said in chapter 1
							But they turned aside
						By turning aside from God, they became worthless
							What is the worth of a human being?
								Nothing if they do not follow God
								All of our worth is dependent upon Christ, in whom we "live and move and have our being"
					No one does good
						Even those things we do which seem good are done for self-serving reasons
						Aside from Christ, no human being has ever, of their own volition, done good

		PSALM 14 The wicked of the earth have turned aside from God and consume His people, but He shall protect His people and be a terror to the wicked (Psalm 14)
			All men have foolishly turned aside from God and become corrupt (1-3)
				All men have foolishly denied God and turned to evil (1)
				God looks down from heaven and sees that all men have turned aside from following Him (2, 3)
					God looks down from heaven to see if there are any who seek Him (2)
					All men have turned aside from God and become corrupt (3)

	Summary
	 	All, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin
	Application
		Don't take pride in my own good deeds
			I don't have my own good deeds, only the good that the Spirit works in me.
3:13-18
	3:13, 14
		Observations
			Their is an outward spatial progression in verse 13: throat, tongue, lips
			13a		Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive
				Quoted from Psalm 5:9

				PSALM 5: In his affliction, David prayed that God would judge the wicked and be a refuge to the righteous
					David's enemies spoke in lies and David prayed that God would judge them for such (9, 10)
						David's enemies spoke only lies and flattery and used their tongues to work death and destruction (9)

				Men speak lies rather than the truth
					Out of the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks
					If we speak lies rather than the truth, then the truth is not in us
				Deceitful speach brings forth death
					Deceitful speach comes from those who are spiritually dead
				Flattery is both deceitful and destructive
				Flatter vs deceive
					Flatter
						Hebrew chalaq
						To be smooth, slippery, deceitful
					Deceive
						Greek dolioo
						To deceive, use deceit
			13b		The venom of asps is under their lips
				Quoted from Psalm 140:3

				PSALM 140: David prayed for God to protect him and destroy the wicked people who conspired against him
					David asked God for protection from wicked men who opposed him (1-5)
						David asked God to deliver him from evil men who conspired against him (1-3)
							The words of evil men are as deadly as the poison of snakes (3)

				Men use their words and speech as poison and as a weapon to kill and destroy

			14		Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness
				Quotes from Psalm 10:7

				PSALM 10: The wicked oppress as God seems distant, but God notes their iniquity and will establish justice
					God seems to stand far off while the wicked oppress with no fear of His judgement (1-11)
						The wicked oppress the poor and do not fear God's judgement (2-11)
							The wicked use their mouths to curse, deceive, and oppress the poor (7)

				Full
					Curses and bitterness are what is there so curses and bitterness are what regularly come out
						Not just occasionally
				Curses
					Men use the mouths that God gave them to curse their creator
					Men use those same mouths to curse their fellow men who are made in God's image
				Bitterness vs deceit and opperession
					Deceit and oppression
						Hebrew: Mirmah tok
							Mirmah
								Deceit, treachery
							Tok
								Injury, oppression, oppressor
					Bitterness
						Greek: Pikria
							Bitter gall
								Extreme wickedness
								A bitter root and so producing a bitter fruit
								Metaphorical bitterness or bitter hatred
				Bitterness
					Their curses could be provoked by a bitterness toward God
					Could simply indicate the working of extreme wickedness with their mouths
						This could be manifested through deception and oppression of others
				They constantly use their mouths to harm others
					Through curses, deception, opression, etc...
		Summary
			Men use their mouths to deceive, harm, and destroy others
		Application
			Ask God to change how I use my mouth
				Ask Him to make me use it for truth and encouragement rather than lies and destruction
	3:15-17
		Observations

			Paraphrased from Isaiah 59:7, 8

			ISAIAH:	Israel rejected God in favor of idols, and so God will judge them among the rest of the nations, but He will then turn their hearts toward Him and bless them
				Although Israel sinfully follows idols, God will turn them back to Him, atone for their iniquities, and prosper them over all other nations (40 - 66)
					God will send the Messiah to atone for the iniquities of those who seek Him, but He will judge those who wickedly seek after idols (52:7 - 59:20)
						Israel lives in sin and rebellion, but God will save those who repent as surely as He will judge those who continue in sin (56:9 - 59:20)
							God is able to save, but Israel lives in complete depravity and sin and so He will come in judgement (59:1-20)
								God is able to save Israel but does not because everything they do is only evil continually (59:1-8)
									All of the ways where the Israelites walk lead to evil (59:7, 8)

			Romans 3:15-17										Isaiah 59:7, 8
				Their feet are swift to shed blood;					Their feet run to evil,
																	and they are swift to shed innocent blood;
																	and their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;
				in their paths are ruin and misery,					desolation and destruction are in their highways.
				and the way of peace they have not known.			The way of peace they do not know,

			Everything is related to travel
				feet
				paths
				way
			Their feet are swift to shed blood
				They are eager to go and kill the innocent
				They don't just set a trap and wait for victims to come by
				They actively pursue their prey
				They do not hesitate; they shed blood swiftly
				Isaiah says their feet run to evil
					Rather than running to God and pursuing good, they run to evil and pursue it instead

			In their paths are ruin and misery					Desolation and destruction are in their highways
				Ruin												Desolation
					Greek syntrimma										Hebrew shod
						Calamity, ruin, destruction							Havoc, violence, destruction, devastation, ruin
				Misery												Destruction
					Greek talaiporia									Hebrew sheber
						Hardship, trouble, calamity, misery					breaking, fracture, crushing, breach, crash, ruin, shattering

				The paths that they walk in are full of destruction and hardship
					They experience calamities themselves
					They cause calamities for others
					The way they walk and live will ultimately lead to their own ruin
						Brought about by the righteous judgement of God

			The way of peace they have not known
				Paul puts this into past tense
					Is he foreshadowing that the righteousness of God (and, by extension, the way of peace) will be manifested apart from the law?
				This verse is a direct contrast to the previous verse
					They walk in the way of destruction and not in the way of peace
					The way of peace and the way of destruction are two different ways
						You cannot walk in both
					Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.
						Matthew 7:13, 14
				There is a way that leads to peace
					This is the way of repentence and forgiveness, which is Jesus
						All who enter by Him will have life
				This way is unknown to mankind at large
					God has revealed it, but men choose to neglect it
					Men have no peace because they refuse to know the Way of peace
		Summary
			Men follow the way of murder and ruin rather than knowing the way of peace
		Application
			Ask God for guidance in following the way of peace and avoiding the way of destruction
	3:18
		Observations				There is no fear of God before their eyes
			Quoted from Psalm 36:1

			PSALM 36: The wikcked do evil continually, but God, who is loving and just, will protect His people from the wicked
				The wicked accept evil and do not fear God (1-4)
					The wicked are influenced by transgression rather than fearing the Lord (1)

			Paul uses this as a summary statement to conclude his remarks of 3:10-18
				This also identifies the root problem
					They speak and pursue evil because they do not fear the Lord.
			"The eye is the lamp of the body. ... but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" - Matt 6:22, 23
			"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge." - Prov 1:7
			This completes the progression
				Mouth
					They speak evil
				Feet
					They pursue evil
				Eyes
					They choose not see God
			They choose not to see God for who He is
		Summary
			Men wrongfully choose to see no reason to fear the Lord
		Application
			Fear the Lord and live life in accordance with that fear.
	Summary
		Men do not fear the Lord and therefore they speak and pursue that which is evil
	9-18 Summary
		All men have chosen not to fear God, and therefore pursue their own wicked way
3:19, 20
	Observations
		19
			Whatever the law speaks
				It speaks to those who are under the law
					so that every mouth may be stopped
					and the whole world may be held accountable to God

			The law speaks to all who are under its authority
				Everyone who is not freed by Christ is under the authority of the Law
			The reason the law speaks is to hold the whole world accountable to God
				The purpose of the law is to hold men accountable for their sin
				The law applied to the entire world
					Not just Israel
				The law accomplishes its purpose
					All men are accountable to God
						All who reject God will be judged
							All have rejected God
							All will be judged

		20
			For by works of the law no human being will be justifies in His sight
				Since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
				The purpose of the law is not salvific

			The law justifies nobody
				Justifying men was not the purpose of the law
					The purpose of the law was to condemn sinners
			According to the righteous decree of the law, all of us should perish
			Through the law comes knowledge of sin
				The law teaches us what sin is

	Summary
		The law holds all men accountable for their sins and condemns everyone
	Application
		Don't depend on works for salvation
