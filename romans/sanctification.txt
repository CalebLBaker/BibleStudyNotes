Romans 6, 7

Romans outline
	ROMANS:	God sovereignly saves sinners through faith and protects them with His love so that they might live to glorify Him
		Paul wrote to the faithful Romans and desired to visit them and spread further the gospel that had changed them (1:1-15)
		The gospel (1:16 - 15:12)
			Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe (1:16, 17)
			Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
				Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
					The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
					We can rejoice in God because His grace overcomes our sin so that His righteousness is counted to us by faith in Jesus apart from the law (3:21 - 5:21)
					Sanctification - the righteous shall live by faith(6, 7)
						We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin with Christ and have been raised with Him into newness of life (6:1-4)
					Security - power of God (8)
					Sovereignty - to the Jew first and also to the Greek (9-11)
			Paul describes how believers should act in response to the mercy of God - not ashamed of the gospel (12:1 - 15:12)
		Personal letter to the Romans (15:13-16:27)

6:1-4
	6:1, 2
		Observations
			1 - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
				Paul raises a hypothetical response to the truth of 5:20, 21
					If grace abounds when sin increases, shouldn't we continue to increase sin so that grace will increase more?
				It is finally time to address the objection of 3:8
					"And why not do evil that good may come? - as some people slanderously charge us with saying.
			2 - By no means! How can we who have died to sin still live in it?
				Paul responds with a very simple argument
					We have died to sin.
					You cannot perpetually live in something that you have died to
					Therefore, we cannot continue to live in sin
				If we continue to live in sin, then we have not truly died to it
				Paul will give an argument for how we know that we have died to sin in the following verses
		Summary
			We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin
		Application
			Put to death the deeds of the flesh
			Do not live in sin
			A christian ought to act different than a non-christian because the christian has died to sin
	6:3, 4
		Observations
			3 - Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ were baptized into His death?
				Paul assumes that Christians have been baptized
					This is a reasonable assumption since Christ commands His followers to be baptized
				Paul states a fact about baptism
					Christian baptism is baptism into Christ, specifically into His death
					When we are saved we become one with Christ
						Therefore, we die with Christ because Christ died and we are one with Him
						Baptism is the physical sign that represents the spiritual reality of our death with Christ
			4
				By baptism we were buried with Christ into death	- i.e. we died with Him
				When Christ died, He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father
					Therefore, since we are one with Him and died the same death as Him, we also are raised by the glory of the Father
				What does it mean "by the glory of the Father"?
					"for the glory of the Father" would make more sense since Christ's resurrection brings glory to the Father
					If God were not glorious, He would not have raised Christ from the dead
						If so, then Christ's resurrection acts as proof of the glory of God
						Our resurrection also acts as proof of the glory of God
				Because we have been raised from the dead, we can walk in newness of life.
			Using the context of the previous verses we can deduce that the death we died with Christ was a death to sin
			Therefore, the newness of life that we walk in a new holiness
			We have died to sin and come alive to holiness
		Summary
			We have been baptized with Christ into death and raised with Him into newness of life
	Summary
		We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin with Christ and have been raised with Him into newness of life

6:5-11
	6:5 - For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His
		Observations
			Just as Christ died to sin, we have also died to sin
			Just as Christ rose from the dead, we shall also rise from the dead
			There is an already, not yet aspect to this
				We have already died to sin and become alive to Christ
					This happened when we were saved
				We will one day physically die and then, eventually, be resurrected in glorified bodies like Christ was
			This is part of what it means to be one with Christ - what happens to Him happens to us
			This passage reinforces the point that Christ is the firstborn of the dead
				He was the first to be fully ressurected into a glorified body
				He is not the only one, we also shall be resurrected into glorified bodies
			Our death to sin with Him united us to Him through faith and adoption
			Our resurrection like His will further unite us with Him
				I'm not certain what manner in which this resurrection will unite us to Christ other than giving us the same type of bodies that He has and fully removing us from sin
		Summary
			For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His
	
	6:6, 7
		Observations
			6 - We know that our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enlaved to sin.
				Our old self was crucified with Him
					Because we are united with Christ, we died when He died
						Specifically, our old, sinful selves died
					The body of sin might be brought to nothing
						By our death, our sin is brought to nothing
							Sin had power over our old selves
							When we died, the ones that sin had power over died
							Having power over a dead person is the same as having nothing
					We are no longer a slave to sin
						A person can be a slave as long as they are alive
						By death, a slave is released from their slavery
						Therefore, when we die we are released from slavery to sin
						Sin looses its authority over us when we die to it
			7 - For one who has died has been set free from sin
				This is restating the last clause of verse 6 for emphasis
		Summary
			Because our old selves have been crucified with Christ, we have been set free from slavery to sin

		6:9 - Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him
			Observations
				Dying with Christ unites us with Him
				If we are united with Christ, then what happens to Him happens to us
				So if He lives, then we live with Him
				This has already-not yet stuff going on
					We already live with Him through the renewing power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. We are alive to Christ
					A day will come when we are resurrected into glorious heavenly bodies just as He was
			Summary
				Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him
