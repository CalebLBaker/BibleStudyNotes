Romans outline
	ROMANS:	God sovereignly saves sinners through faith and protects them with His love so that they might live to glorify Him
		Paul wrote to the faithful Romans and desired to visit them and spread further the gospel that had changed them (1:1-15)
		The gospel (1:16 - 15:12)
			Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe (1:16, 17)
			Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
				Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
					The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
					We can rejoice in God because His grace overcomes our sin so that His righteousness is counted to us by faith in Jesus apart from the law (3:21 - 5:21)
					Sanctification - the righteous shall live by faith(6, 7)
						We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin with Christ and have been raised with Him into newness of life (6:1-4)
						We have been united to Christ through dying with Him to sin and being raised with Him to God (6:5-11)
					Security - power of God (8)
					Sovereignty - to the Jew first and also to the Greek (9-11)
			Paul describes how believers should act in response to the mercy of God - not ashamed of the gospel (12:1 - 15:12)
		Personal letter to the Romans (15:13-16:27)
	
Outlines of cited books

	EXODUS:	God honored His promise to Abraham by rescuing the Israelites out of Egypt and establishing an eternal covenant with them
		God used Moses to demonstrate His divine power in freeing and saving Israel from the Egyptians (1-18)
		God established a covenant with Israel and Israel, after initially breaking the covenant, repented and did as God commanded them to do (19-40)
			God established a covenant with Israel and instructed them in how to keep the covenant (19-31)
				The Israelites were consecrated and warned so that Moses could meet with God at the top of Mount Sinai (19)
				God gave the Israelites commands regarding how to honor Him and run their nation (20-23)
					God gave the Israelites ten commandments for them to follow (20:1-21)
						God gave Moses the ten commandments (20:1-17)
							God spoke to Moses (20:1)
							God is the God of Israel, who brought them out of slavery (20:2)
							Have no other gods before God (20:3)
							Do not make or worship idols because YHWH is a jealous God (20:4-6)
							Do not take the name of YHWH in vain (20:7)
							Keep the Sabbath holy and do not work on it for YHWH made the universe in six days and then rested on the seventh (20:8-11)
							Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long (20:12)
							Do not murder (20:13)
							Do not commit adultery (20:14)
							Do not steal (20:15)
							Do not bear false witness against your neighbor (20:16)
							Do not covet anything that is your neighbor's (20:17)
						The Israelites feared God and asked Moses to speak to God on their behalf (20:18-21)
					God gave the Israelites instruction on how to live in the land that he would give to them (20:22 - 23:33)
				God confirmed His covenant with Israel (24)
				God gave Moses specific directions for how Israel could come before Him (25-31)
			Israel broke their covenant with God, but God, after revealing His wrath, revealed His mercy by reinstituting the covenant (32-34)
			The Israelites constructed all that God commanded them to construct and then God's Presence came to dwell with them (35-40)


6:1-4
	6:1, 2
		Observations
			1 - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
				Paul raises a hypothetical response to the truth of 5:20, 21
					If grace abounds when sin increases, shouldn't we continue to increase sin so that grace will increase more?
				It is finally time to address the objection of 3:8
					"And why not do evil that good may come? - as some people slanderously charge us with saying.
			2 - By no means! How can we who have died to sin still live in it?
				Paul responds with a very simple argument
					We have died to sin.
					You cannot perpetually live in something that you have died to
					Therefore, we cannot continue to live in sin
				If we continue to live in sin, then we have not truly died to it
				Paul will give an argument for how we know that we have died to sin in the following verses
		Summary
			We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin
		Application
			Put to death the deeds of the flesh
			Do not live in sin
			A christian ought to act different than a non-christian because the christian has died to sin
	6:3, 4
		Observations
			3 - Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ were baptized into His death?
				Paul assumes that Christians have been baptized
					This is a reasonable assumption since Christ commands His followers to be baptized
				Paul states a fact about baptism
					Christian baptism is baptism into Christ, specifically into His death
					When we are saved we become one with Christ
						Therefore, we die with Christ because Christ died and we are one with Him
						Baptism is the physical sign that represents the spiritual reality of our death with Christ
			4
				By baptism we were buried with Christ into death	- i.e. we died with Him
				When Christ died, He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father
					Therefore, since we are one with Him and died the same death as Him, we also are raised by the glory of the Father
				What does it mean "by the glory of the Father"?
					"for the glory of the Father" would make more sense since Christ's resurrection brings glory to the Father
					If God were not glorious, He would not have raised Christ from the dead
						If so, then Christ's resurrection acts as proof of the glory of God
						Our resurrection also acts as proof of the glory of God
				Because we have been raised from the dead, we can walk in newness of life.
			Using the context of the previous verses we can deduce that the death we died with Christ was a death to sin
			Therefore, the newness of life that we walk in a new holiness
			We have died to sin and come alive to holiness
		Summary
			We have been baptized with Christ into death and raised with Him into newness of life
	Summary
		We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin with Christ and have been raised with Him into newness of life

6:5-11
	6:5 - For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His
		Observations
			Just as Christ died to sin, we have also died to sin
			Just as Christ rose from the dead, we shall also rise from the dead
			There is an already, not yet aspect to this
				We have already died to sin and become alive to Christ
					This happened when we were saved
				We will one day physically die and then, eventually, be resurrected in glorified bodies like Christ was
			This is part of what it means to be one with Christ - what happens to Him happens to us
			This passage reinforces the point that Christ is the firstborn of the dead
				He was the first to be fully resurrected into a glorified body
				He is not the only one, we also shall be resurrected into glorified bodies
			Our death to sin with Him united us to Him through faith and adoption
			Our resurrection like His will further unite us with Him
				I'm not certain what manner in which this resurrection will unite us to Christ other than giving us the same type of bodies that He has and fully removing us from sin
		Summary
			For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His
	
	6:6, 7
		Observations
			6 - We know that our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enlaved to sin.
				Our old self was crucified with Him
					Because we are united with Christ, we died when He died
						Specifically, our old, sinful selves died
					The body of sin might be brought to nothing
						By our death, our sin is brought to nothing
							Sin had power over our old selves
							When we died, the ones that sin had power over died
							Having power over a dead person is the same as having nothing
					We are no longer a slave to sin
						A person can be a slave as long as they are alive
						By death, a slave is released from their slavery
						Therefore, when we die we are released from slavery to sin
						Sin looses its authority over us when we die to it
			7 - For one who has died has been set free from sin
				This is restating the last clause of verse 6 for emphasis
		Summary
			Because our old selves have been crucified with Christ, we have been set free from slavery to sin

	6:8 - Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him
		Observations
			Dying with Christ unites us with Him
			If we are united with Christ, then what happens to Him happens to us
			So if He lives, then we live with Him
			This has already-not yet stuff going on
				We already live with Him through the renewing power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. We are alive to Christ
				A day will come when we are resurrected into glorious heavenly bodies just as He was
		Summary
			Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him
	6:9, 10
		Observations
			9 - We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will dever die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.
				Because Christ has been raised from the dead, death no longer has dominion over Him
				Because death no longer has dominion over Him, He will never die again
				Did death ever have dominion over Him?
					He died, so yes
				How can death have dominion over the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25)?
					This can only happen if Jesus willingly gives death dominion over Himself
					Even then, it is only a temporary dominion
						Christ is the Resurrection, therefore, He will be resurrected
						"God raised Him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it." - Acts 2:24
				Death has no dominion over Him because He rose from the dead
				He rose from the dead because it was not possible for death to hold Him
				It is not possible for death to hold Him because He is the Resurrection and the Life
			10 - For the death He died He died to sin, once for all, but the life He lives He lives to God
				He died to sin
					His death defeats sin
					He is dead to sin - sin has no power over Him
					once for all - His one death to sin counts as death to sin for all who are in Him
						All who are in Him are dead to sin; sin has no power over them
				He lives to God
					He lives now with the purpose of glorifying God
					All who died to sin with Him now live to God with Him
						Their purpose is now to glorify God
		Summary
			Christ, having been raised from the dead, now lives to God and is free from the dominion of sin and death
		Application
			I now live to God; Everything I do should be done with the purpose of glorifying God
			I am dead to sin; sin no longer has dominion over me
	6:11 - So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus
		Observations
			So you also
				What follows us is true of us because it is true of Jesus
				These words indicate that this verse gives the logical conclusion of the paragraph
			must consider yourselves
				What follows is already true of us
				If it is true, then it would be good for us to consider it to be true
					If we considered it to be false we would be deceiving ourselves
				As long as we live like this is false, sin and the old man still have power over us
				This is the first direct command in the book of Romans
			dead to sin
				We have died to sin
				Sin has no more power over us because we are dead to it
				We cannot be slaves to something that we are dead to
			alive to God
				The life we now live we live with the purpose of bringing glory to God
				It is God who brought us to life and it is God whom we must serve with our lives
			in Christ Jesus
				All of this is true of us because it is true of Jesus and we have been united with Jesus
		Summary
			So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus
	Summary
		We have been united to Christ through dying with Him to sin and being raised with Him to God
6:12-14
	12 - Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.
		Observations
			Therefore
				This verses is intimately connected with the preceding paragraph
				The fact that we have, with Christ, died to sin is the motivating thought behind this verse
			Because we are dead to sin, sin should not be able to reign over us
				We are able to resist the rule of sin because we are dead to it
				Sin has no power over us
			This is a command, not a statement of fact
				Although we are dead to sin and it no longer has any intrinsic power over us, we still let it have power over us
			If we let sin reign in our mortal bodies, then it will make us obey it
			It is only through Christ that we can resist sin
		Summary
			Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.
		Application
			Do not let sin have power over you
			Submit to Christ, rather than to sin
	13
		Observations
			This verse is describing how to go about not letting sin reign in our mortal bodies
			Our members are instruments - they will be used for some purpose
				They can be used by sin to work unrighteousness
				They can be used by God to work righteousness
			There is a motivation, power, and obligation for presenting our members to God as instruments of righteousness
				We are those who have been brought from death to life
					It is God who brought us to life, therefore we have an obligation to God
					We are no longer dead in our sin; God gives us the power to present ourselves to Him to work righteousness
			We cannot present our members both to sin and to God
				"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other" - Matt 6
					Jesus was talking about serving God and money, but the teaching applies equally well to serving God and sin.
				There are two laws at work within us: the law of righteousness and life and the law of sin and death.
					These laws are at war with one another; to serve one is to fight against the other
			If we present our members to sin, sin will make us obey its passions
			If we present our members to God, God will work righteousness in us
			The way in which we present our members to God as instruments of righteousness is by presenting our whole selves to Him as those who have been brought from death to life
				It is those whom God brings from death to life that He uses to work righteousness
				Our righteousness begins with humbly admitting that we are in God's debt and would be dead in sin without Him
		Summary
			We should not present our members to sin for works of unrighteousness, but rather to God for works of righteousness
	14
		Observations
			For
				This verse provides motivation for the preceding verse
				The reason we should present our members to God as instruments to righteousness and not to sin as instruments of unrighteousness is because, ultimately, sin will have no dominion over us
			Sin cannot have dominion over those who are under grace
				Grace destroys the condemning power of sin
			Those who are in Christ are not under the law, but under grace
		Summary
			For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under the law but under grace.
	Summary
		Because they have been freed from sin by grace, believers should offer themselves to God rather than allowing sin to continue to reign in their lives.
6:15-19
	15
		Observations
			Paul now considers the consequences of our freedom from the law
				If we are free from the law, does that make us free to break the law and sin however we please?
					Of course not!
		Summary
			Be under grace rather than the law does not give us license to sin
	16
		Observations
			What does it mean to continue to sin?
				Continuing to sin is like continuing to obey the demands of sin
					If you continue to obey sin, you are still a slave to sin and are not free from it.
			You are a slave to the one whom you obey, whether it be sin or righteousness.
			Slavery to sin leads to death
			Slavery to obedience leads to righteousness
		Summary
			If you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin or of obedience
	17-18
		Observations
			17
				Thanks be to God
					Paul gives God credit for the Romans' obedience and their freedom from sin
				you who were once slaves of sin
					The Roman believers had previously been slaves to sin
				have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed
					The Roman believers were entrusted to follow the teachings of the gospel
					The Roman believers were obedient to the teachings of the gospel
						This obedience was from the heart (i.e. not superficial)
			18
				The Romans' obedience to the God's commands brought them freedom from sin
				Being free from sin, the Romans became slaves to righteousness
		Summary
			Paul gives thanks to God that the Romans have become free from sin and obedient slaves to righteousness
	19
		Observations
			Paul is using something from human experience as an analogy to explain a more difficult concept
				Slavery is an imperfect, but helpful analogy that the Romans would have been familiar with
			The Roman believers at one time presented themselves as slaves to impurity and lawlessness
				Slavery to lawlessness leads to more lawlessness
			Now that the Roman believers are free from impurity, Paul calls them to present themselves with the same level of obedience to righteousness
				Obedience to righteousness leads to sanctification (becoming more set apart and different from the world)
			Slavery to lawlessness or righteousness leads to greater levels of lawlessness or righteousness
		Summary
			Just as you once presented your members as slaves to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness
	Summary
		Since they are no longer slaves to sin, the Roman believers need to stop obeying it and instead become obedient slaves to righteousness
4:20-23
	20
		Observations
			You cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24)
				If you are a slave to sin, you are free in regards to righteousness
				If you are a slave to righteousness, you are free in regards to sin
		Summary
			For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness
	21
		Observations
			Paul asks a rhetorical question
				What benefit did the Romans gain from being slaves to sin and free from righteousness?
					The assumed answer is no
					Not only did they gain nothing from their freedom from righteousness, they are now ashamed of the things that they did with that freedom
					Slavery to sin and freedom from righteousness both lead to death
		Summary
			Rather than bringing about any kind of benefit, slavery to sin and freedom from righteousness bring about death
	22
		Observations
			The Roman believers have been set free from sin and become slaves of God
				All believers are slaves of God
				All unbelievers are slaves of sin
				Any given human is a slave of sin xor a slave of God
			The fruit of slavery to God leads to sanctification
				Sanctification is continually becoming more set apart from the world and more like Christ
			The fruit of slavery to God ends in eternal life
				Eternal life is daily abiding in Christ from now through all eternity and never experiencing death again
		Summary
			But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit that you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.
	23
		This verse is acting as a summary of the preceding paragraph
			The wages of sin is death
				A life lived in slavery to sin ends in spiritual death
			The free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
				Eternal life is a free gift
					We do nothing to earn it
				This gift is in Christ Jesus our Lord
					It is accomplished by Christ
					We must become in Christ to receive it
					Christ Jesus is our Lord
						This free gift should prompt us to submit ourselves to Christ as slaves
			Wages verses free gift
				Wages are given to a worker
					When we serve sin as its slave, we are given our wages, which are death
				A free gift requires nothing in return and requires nothing to earn it
					We receive eternal life before we become slaves to righteousness
					God gives us this gift while we are still slaves to sin
				Death and eternal life are, ultimately, incompatible
					If we receive God's free gift, we cannot fully collect on the wages of continued slavery to sin
						There is, however, lesser kinds of death that can result from continued obedience to sin after receiving God's free gift
				Wages are earned and deserved
					We deserve death
				Gifts are unmerited and underserved
					We do not deserve eternal life
		Summary
			The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord
	Summary
		Slavery to sin ends in death, but slavery to God ends in eternal life

7:1-3
	Observations
		1
			I am speaking to those who know the law
				Paul assumes that the church has a working knowledge of the law
			The law is binding on a person only as long as he lives
				Those who are dead don't need to follow the law because they are dead
				Therefore, those who have died with Christ are no longer bound by the law
		2
			A married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives
				Marriage is a life-long covenant; the law forbids it from being broken while both parties live
				To leave a marriage while your spouse still lives is adultery
			If her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage
				It is not adultery to remarry if your first spouse is dead
				The law cannot bind someone to another person who is not under the law
					Dead people are not under the law
		3
			She will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive
				This follows from verse 2
			If her husband dies, she is free from the law
				Death brings someone outside the jurisdiction of the law
				A covenant made by the law is rendered invalid if one party leaves the jurisdiction of the law
				Therefore, one spouse dying frees the other from being bound by the marriage
			If she marries another man she is not an adulteress
				The first marriage has been rendered invalid, therefore it cannot be violated
		Paul is using the example of marriage to demonstrate a spiritual reality
			Just as physical death breaks the bonds of marriage, so spiritual death breaks the bondage of sin and the law
	Summary
		The law is binding on a person only as long as he lives

7:4-6
	7:4
		Observations
			You also have died to the law through the body of Christ
				Having died with Christ, believers are dead to the law
					Therefore, the law no longer has any power over them
				So that you may belong to another
					Since sin and the law no longer have any power over believers, believers no longer belong to sin and the law
					Believers belong to Christ who redeemed them from sin and the law
				To him who has been raised from the dead
					Just as believers died in Christ, they will also be raised with him
					Christ's resurrection is a symbol of his power and authority over death
				In order that we may bear fruit for God
					Christ's resurrection is what allows us to bear fruit for God
					The resurrection is what evidences the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice (all was paid so there was no longer any need for him to stay dead)
					Dead things and dead people don't bear fruit
						We died with Christ and could not bear fruit so long as we stayed dead
						When we died with Christ, we were also raised with him to newness of life
						In this new life we have, we bear fruit for God rather than fruit for sin, as we did in our previous life
							We bear fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control
							We no longer bear fruit of sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these
		Summary
			We have died to the law through Christ so that we might belong to him in order to bear fruit for God
	7:5
		Observations
			While we were living in the flesh
				We were at one time living in the flesh
				This was before we died to sin
				The flesh is sinful (ch 1, 2)
			Our sinful passions were at work in our members to bear fruit for death
				Our sinful passions pushed us to obedient to sin
				Obedience of sin brings about the wages of sin, which is death
			Aroused by the law
				So depraved is mankind, that being commanded not to do something can be a temptation to do it
		Summary
			While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions worked to bear fruit for death
	7:6
		Observations
			Now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive
				As verse 1 establishes, we are released from the law when we die because the law has no authority over those who have died
				Sin and the law were that which held us captive
				It is because we identify with Christ and have been baptized into His death that we have died to sin and the law
			So that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code
				Paul has already established that, being free from sin, we are now slaves to righteousness
				He now hints at how we go about serving righteousness
				It is not like how we served the law
					It is not a strict adherence to some written code
				Our service is in the Spirit
					It is not by our own power that we serve, but rather by the power of the Spirit of God who has been given to us
					God gives us the power to serve God
					The way in which we serve righteousness is to be submissive to the Spirit of God and to heed His guidance
					It is necessary for our service to God that the Spirit be given to us because we lack the ability and conviction to serve Him of our own powers
						Our flesh is sinful and not conducive to divine service
		Now that we are released from the law, we serve in the Spirit rather than in the written code
	General observations
		This passage has relevance both to the transition in redemptive history from pre-church age to church age and to the transition in an individual that happens at salvations
			Redemptive History
				Jews before Christ could be righteous through faith, but they did not have the Spirit living in them and so they had to serve "in the old way of the written code"
					Without the power of the Spirit, they were less able to resist their sinful passions and so they bore fruit for death
				By sending the Spirit, God freed His people from slavery to the law and gave them the power to resist their sinful passions
			Individual
				Unbelievers who don't know Christ are left in a state of slavery to their sinful passions; the only thing they know to do results in bearing fruit for death
					The only way of resisting it they know of would be strict adherence to a written code
				Dying with Christ makes them righteous and frees them from slavery to sin

	Summary
		Dying with Christ replaces service through written codes and fruit for death with service through the Spirit which bears fruit for God (7:4-6)
	
7:7-12

	Cited passage:
		God honored His promise to Abraham by rescuing the Israelites out of Egypt and establishing an eternal covenant with them (Exodus)
			God established a covenant with Israel and Israel, after initially breaking the covenant, repented and did as God commanded them to do (19-40)
				God established a covenant with Israel and instructed them in how to keep the covenant (19-31)
					God gave the Israelites commands regarding how to honor Him and run their nation (20-23)
						God gave the Israelites ten commandments for them to follow (20:1-21)
							God gave Moses the ten commandments (20:1-17)
								Do not covet anything that is your neighbor's (20:17)

	7
		Observations
			Paul has been noting how, before Christ, people were slaves to the law and slaves to sin
			He has also been noting how Christ frees people from sin and frees people from the law
			Using the law and sin in such similar terms bring up the question of "Is the law sin?"
				The answer is definitely not
			So if the law is not sin, what is the law?
				The law is something that brings knowledge of sin
					Man would sin whether he had the law or not, but without the law he would not realize that he was sinning
					In that way, Paul can say that "if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin"
					Paul then uses the specific example of coveting (Exodus 20:17)
						We would never have thought about what coveting is nor would we have known that it is wrong without the law
						However, since the law says "You shall not covet", we know that coveting is wrong
						Our sin natures, however, go further than that. Sometimes knowing that something is wrong can prompt us to do that thing
							As if the law, by saying what not to do, is giving sin ideas of what to do (namely, the very things that the law says not to do)
		Summary
			The law is not sin, but rather it is something that gives knowledge of sin and shows us what sin is
	8
		Observations
			Sin is intrinsically rebellious; if given something to rebel against it will rebel
			But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness
				The law gives our sinful nature ideas on how to break the law
					"I say to you, don't think about elephants. What are you thinking about?"
			Apart from the law, sin lies dead.
				Without the law, sin has nothing to rebel against;
				You still sin without the law, but sin is, in a sense, more dormant because it can't rebel without having a law to rebel against
		Summary
			Sin uses the law as an opportunity to be rebellious
	9-11
		Observations
			9
				I was once alive apart from the law   -  I really don't know what to do with this
				When the commandment came, sin came alive and I died
					The commandment gave sin something to rebel against, so sin could act more fully
					The result of sin, as has been discussed previously, is death
			10
				The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.
					The commandment explained how to be righteous - and the fruit of righteousness is life
					However, the commandment did not give the power to do the right thing
						And so sin used this explanation of right and wrong to guide it in doing the wrong
						The result of sin is death
			11
				For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
					The commandment provided sin an opportunity
					Sin deceives people into thinking that they can keep the law in their own power
						They can't - when they try they sinfully break the law and are left to die in their sins
		Summary
			We were once somewhat alive apart from the law, but when we heard the law sin used it as an opportunity to bring about a more complete death
	12
		Observations
			This verse seems to contradict what the previous 4 verses were saying
				The previous verses explain how sin works through the law to bring death
				This verse says that the law is good
			It is not the law that brings death, but rather sin that brings death
				The law itself is a good thing from God
				Just because sin takes a good thing and uses it for an evil purpose does not make that thing evil itself
			Law and commandment are used as synonyms
			The law is holy, righteous, and good, because it shows us how to be holy, righteous, and good
				However, sin is able to take advantage of the law because the law does not give us the power to do what it says
		Summary
			The law is holy and righteous and good
	Summary
		The law is holy, righteous, and good, but sin takes advantage of it and uses it for evil to cause us to sin and to kill us
7:13-20
	13
		Observations
			Did that which is good then bring death to me?
				The law is good
				Sin brings death through the law
				So does that which is good bring death?
					No
						It was sin that brought death, not the law
							Death came through the law, but death did not come from the law
			In order that sin might be shown to be sin
				The law defines what sin is
				Sin takes this as an opportunity to do evil by rebelliously doing exactly what the law says not to do
				The law in turn uses this as an opportunity to identify sin so that it cannot be denied that sin is sin
			And through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure
				Not only does the presence of the law provoke sin to rebel against the rules, it also increases accountability by removing any plea of ignorance
				In multiple ways the greatness of sin is increased by the presence of the law
		Summary
			The law did not produce death; sin produced death through the law so that sin is clearly identified
	14
		Observations
			For we know that the law is spiritual
				The law comes from the Holy Spirit, who is God
			But I am of the flesh, sold under sin
				Paul is apparently speaking from the perspective of someone who has not received the Holy Spirit
				Of the flesh - acting based on the carnal instincts of sinful man
				Sold under sin - in bondage and slavery to sin, as discussed in the last chapter or so
			"The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned." - I Corinthians 2:14
			Those who do not have Christ cannot accept or keep the law because they are operating in their own flesh and are slaves to sin
		Summary
			The law is spiritual, but before salvation we were of the flesh and slaves to sin
	15
		Observations
			For I do not understand my own actions
				The unbeliever who tries to keep the law finds that they cannot; They frequently find themselves sinning and don't necessarily understand why they sin
				They sin because they are enslaved to sin. They are doing their master's bidding whether they want to or not
			I do not do what I want
				The unbeliever who tries to keep the law wants to do good, but their slavery to sin prevents them from doing good
			I do the very thing that I hate
				This unbeliever who is trying to keep the law hates evil action
					And yet, due to their slavery to sin, they frequently commit such evil actions themselves and so their hatred of evil turns into hypocrisy
		Summary
			The one who seeks righteousness apart from Christ cannot do what he wants and frequently does what he hates
	16
		Observations
			If I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good
				The speaker wants to do what the law say
					So they agree that what the law says is good
				The speaker does not do what the law says
					So they observe that man does not naturally do good
					So it is good to have something to instruct man in how to do good
				By wanting to keep the law and failing, the speaker shows that the law is good, but insufficient
					It shows the right thing to do but does not give the power to do it
				The law states itself that it is good
					So to say that the law is good is to agree with the law
		Summary
			If I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good
	17
		Observations
			So now it is no longer I who do it but sin that dwells within me
				The influence of sin is so powerful over the unbeliever that it is as if sin is acting through them rather than they controlling their own actions
				They have become slaves to sin, so what they do they do because sin dictates it
					Hence it is really sin acting through them rather than them making their own choices
			Even if the unbeliever wanted to do good (which is the case in this example), they lack the power to do it; sin is in control
			However, this does not remove culpability (see Romans 1:18 - 3:20)
				They have become slaves to sin because they rejected God
		Summary
			Those with the law but not the Spirit are so enslaved to sin as to be unable to prevent sin from doing evil through them
	18
		Observations
			For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh
				If "in my flesh" is a qualifier, then it is evidence that the passage is speaking of a believer
					Nothing good dwells in the unbeliever at all, so the qualifier is not necessary
				If "in my flesh" is a reminder of the type of person being discussed, then it is evidence that the passage is speaking of an unbeliever
					Paul says that nothing good dwells in him, so then he has to remind his readers that he is speaking from the perspective of a person who does not have the Spirit
						This serves the purpose of avoiding the misinterpretation that the Spirit is not good
						Paul does similar things in 7:25 and 1:25
				Nothing good dwells in the person who has the law but not Jesus
					"The heart is deceitful above all else and desperately wicked"
					Even the desire to do good, serves no good purpose without the power to do it
					This person has a need for something good to dwell in them (i.e. the Spirit, which they do not have because they are merely in their flesh)
			I have the desire to do what is right but not the ability to carry it out
				Even unbelievers can have the desire to do what is right
				Nobody who is living in their flesh and is a slave to sin has the power to do what is right
				They need help
		Summary
			Nothing good dwells in the person who does not know Christ, for although they might desire to do good, they lack the power to carry it out

		Observations
			This is simply a repeat of verse 15
			Probably repeated for emphasis
		Summary
			The one who seeks righteousness apart from Christ cannot do what he wants and frequently does what he hates
		
	20
		Observations
			Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me
				When a person is enslaved to sin, sin is able to make them do wicked things that they themselves do not want to do
					In this way, it is sin doing these things through them rather than them doing them themselves
				Sin dwells within me
					Not having something or someone dwelling in you is not an option
						You either have sin dwelling in you or the Spirit of God dwelling in you
					Just as Christians should be controlled by and filled with the Spirit, so unbelievers are controlled by and filled with sin
				This is not to say that a person who is enslaved to sin is not responsible for any of their actions
					Chapter 1 seems to describe how slavery to sin happens: people willfully reject God and, as a result, God gives them over to their sin
						All mankind is morally culpable for our decision to reject God
		Summary
			If I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me
	Summary
		Sin, not the law, brings death to those who are filled and controlled by it and in bondage to it
