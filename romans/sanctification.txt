				Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
					The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
					We can rejoice in God because His grace overcomes our sin so that His righteousness is counted to us by faith in Jesus apart from the law (3:21 - 5:21)

					Security - power of God (8)

6:1-4
	6:1, 2
		Observations
			1 - What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
				Paul raises a hypothetical response to the truth of 5:20, 21
					If grace abounds when sin increases, shouldn't we continue to increase sin so that grace will increase more?
				It is finally time to address the objection of 3:8
					"And why not do evil that good may come? - as some people slanderously charge us with saying.
			2 - By no means! How can we who have died to sin still live in it?
				Paul responds with a very simple argument
					We have died to sin.
					You cannot perpetually live in something that you have died to
					Therefore, we cannot continue to live in sin
				If we continue to live in sin, then we have not truly died to it
				Paul will give an argument for how we know that we have died to sin in the following verses
		Summary
			We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin
		Application
			Put to death the deeds of the flesh
			Do not live in sin
			A christian ought to act different than a non-christian because the christian has died to sin
