8:1-8
	1, 2
		Observations
			1
				Therefore - this is true in light of Christ setting us free from the slavery to sin and death
				Because we are no longer slaves to sin we cannot be condemned
			2
				The law of the Spirit of life is what sets us free from the law of sin and death.
				It is being indwelt by the Spirit and submitting to the law of the Spirit that breaks the power of sin over our lives
					We are slaves to that which we obey - either of sin leading to death or of the Spirit leading to life
					We cannot serve two masters - if we become obedient to the Spirit we cannot continue to be slaves to sin
				If we no are no longer slaves to sin we will no longer receive the wages that come with slavery to sin - namely condemnation and death
		Summary
			There is no condemnation for those whom the law of the Spirit has set free in Christ from the law of sin and death
