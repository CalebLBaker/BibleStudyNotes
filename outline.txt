				ROMANS:	God sovereignly saves sinners through faith and protects them with His love so that they might live to glorify Him
				    Paul wrote to the faithful Romans and desired to visit them and spread further the gospel that had changed them (1:1-15)
				        Paul, called to be Christ's servant and apostle, wrote to Romans who were reached by the gospel of God and called to belong to Christ (1:1-7)
				        Paul thanked God for the faithful witness of the Romans and longed to visit them to strengthen them and spread the gospel (1:8-15)
					The gospel (1:16 - 15:12)
						Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
							Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe (1:16, 17)
							The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
								God's wrath against those who exchange true worship for idolatry is revealed by giving them over to further depravity (1:18-32)
									The wrath of God is revealed against unrighteous men who suppress the truth of God and exchange worship for idolatry (1:18-23)
									Because men exchanged worship of God for idolatry, He gave them over to depravity, entirely corrupting their lives (1:24-32)
										Because men exchanged worship of God for idolatry, God gave them over to the degrading desires of their hearts (1:24, 25)
										Because men exchanged true worship for idolatry, God let them exchange true sexual passions for homosexuality (1:26, 27)
										Because they did not acknowledge God, God gave them over to a debased mind and willful violation of His commands (1:28-32)
								God's judgement is passed on those who judge the sins of others while practicing the very same thing in their own life (2:1-11)
									Those who exploit God's kindness to judge the sins of others rather than repenting will not be spared from judgement (2:1-5)
									God will judge each person according to their works (2:6-11)
								God's judgement is passed on the Jews who, although they have the law, do not keep it (2:12 - 3:8)
									God's judgement pays no respect to ethnicity, unapplied knowledge of the law, or physical rituals (2:12-29)
										The law is available in some form to everyone and people are justified by obeying it not by having it (2:12-16)
										God's people are those who do the law, are Jews inwardly, and have circumcised hearts(2:17-29)
											Although the Jews relied on the law and boasted in God, they dishonored God by breaking the law (2:17-24)
											A true Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart, so physical circumcision is of no value (2:25-29)
									God is glorified through righteously judging the Jews for breaking the law, which He gave them as a special advantage (3:1-8)
								All men have refused to fear God, pursued wickedness, and been justly condemned by the righteous precepts of the law (3:9-20)
									All men, both Jews and Greeks, have chosen not to fear God, and therefore pursue their own wicked way (3:9-18)
									The law holds all men accountable for their sins and condemns everyone (3:19, 20)
							We can rejoice in God because His grace overcomes our sin so that His righteousness is counted to us by faith in Jesus apart from the law (3:21 - 5:21)
								God reveals His righteousness in Christ by atoning for sin so that His righteousness can by justly accounted to all who have faith in Jesus (3:21-26)
								Nobody, not even Abraham, can boast in salvation, because it is guaranteed through faith, rather than through works (3:27 - 4:25)
									Boasting is excluded because we are justified and the law is established through faith, rather than works (3:27-31)
									Abraham could not boast because God's promised justification was guaranteed to him and his offspring through faith rather than through works (4)
										Even Abraham could not boast because he was justified and forgiven by faith as gift and not by works (4:1-8)
										Since Abraham was justified before he was circumcised, he is the father of all, both circumcised and uncircumcised, who are saved by faith (4:9-12)
										God's promise to Abraham was guaranteed to all of his spiritual offspring through faith and not through works (4:13-25)
											God's promise to Abraham was based on faith and it would have been void if it had been based on works (4:13-15)
											God's promises to Abraham are guaranteed to his spiritual offspring through faith in the God who gives life to the dead (4:16-25)
								Because God, through Christ, has justified and reconciled  us, we can rejoice in God's glory, our suffering, and God Himself (5:1-11)
									Because we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God and can rejoice in our suffering (5:1-5)
									We can rejoice in God Himself because, while we were His enemies, Christ died to reconcile us to Him and to save us (5:6-11)
								Adam's transgression brought sin to all who are in him, but Christ's sacrifice brought grace, justification, and life to all who are in Him (5:12-21)
									Sin came through the transgression of Adam and brought death to all mankind because all sinned (5:12-14)
									Christ's gift is not like Adam's trespass (5:15-17)
									Adam's transgression brought a reign of sin and death upon the world, but Christ's grace overcomes sin and death to bring about a rule of righteousness and life (5:18-21)
							Jesus Christ sets us free from slavery to sin and death and causes us to become slaves to righteousness instead (6, 7)
								Dying to sin with Christ and being raised to new life has freed us from sin's power, so we should no longer submit to it (6:1-14)
									We cannot continue to live in sin because we have died to sin with Christ and have been raised with Him into newness of life (6:1-4)
									We have been united to Christ through dying with Him to sin and being raised with Him to God (6:5-11)
									Because we have been freed from sin by grace, we should offer ourselves to God rather than letting sin continue to reign in our lives (6:12-14)
								Because we are no longer enslaved to sin, we should stop obeying it and become slaves of righteousness (6:15-23)
									Since they are no longer slaves to sin, the Roman believers need to stop obeying it and instead become obedient slaves to righteousness (6:15-19)
									Slavery to sin ends in death, but slavery to God ends in eternal life (6:20-23)
								Dying with Christ frees us from the law and death so that we can serve through the Spirit and bear fruit for God (7:1-6)
									The law is binding on a person only as long as he lives (7:1-3)
									Dying with Christ replaces service through written codes and fruit for death with service through the Spirit which bears fruit for God (7:4-6)
								Although the law is good, sin uses the law to enslave and kill those who hear it so that they cannot keep the law even if they rightly desire to (7:7-25)
									The law is holy, righteous, and good, but sin takes advantage of it and uses it for evil to cause us to sin and to kill us (7:7-12)
									Sin, not the law, brings death to those who are filled and controlled by it and in bondage to it (7:13-20)
									Though he delights in God's law, the unbeliever is enslaved to sin and can only be rescued by Jesus

											When Paul came to Corinth he did not try to be impressive, so that the Corinthians would trust in God’s power (2:1-5)
											The wisdom of God is a mystery to the world, but it is known to those who love God (2:6-16)
												The mysterious wisdom of God, which is not known by the rulers of the earth, is spoken among the mature believers (2:6-8)
												Believers have received the Spirit of God so that they can know of the mysterious things that God has prepared for them (2:9-12)
												The natural man cannot know spiritual things, but the spiritual man has the mind of Christ (2:13-16)
									Paul called the Corinthians to build their church in spiritual wisdom rather than arguing over men in human wisdom (3)
										The Corinthians were carnal, and not spiritual, because of the divisions in their church (3:1-4)
										Paul and Apollos helped get the Corinthian church going, but they were not responsible for its success or failure (3:5-17)
											Paul and Apollos just told the Corinthians about God; God is the one who made them believe and should be honored (3:5-8)

								Paul wanted to address issues that the Corinthians raised in their letter to him (I Corinthians 7:1a)
								The Corinthians should not seek to change their marital status (I Corinthians 7:1b-40)

										It is better to love God than to be arrogant in your knowledge (8:1-3)
										Idols are not real: there is only one God (8:4-6)
