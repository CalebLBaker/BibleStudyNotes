                Paul wrote the letter
                    He is a servant of Christ
                        He is owned by Christ
                            He does not own himself
                        He is obedient to Christ
                        He does not seek his own freedom
                        Many prominant figures of the Old Testament were also servants of God
                    He was called to be an apostle
                        God called the apostles
                            Their authority is from God, not from men
                        Paul was sent by God to bear witness about Him
                    He was set apart for the gospel of God
                        God specifically selected Paul for the task which He had for him
                            To bring the gospel to gentiles
                                Acts 13:2
                        Gospel of God
                            The entirity of the gospel is established by God
                            God promised the gospel beforehand
                                Through the Old Testament prophets
                                    See messianic prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Micah, Hosea, etc...
                            The gospel is about Jesus
                                Jesus was physically descended from David
                                    David was God's chosen king of Israel
                                    God had promised David an eternal kingdom (II Samuel 7)
                                Jesus was declared to be the Son of God
                                    see Luke 3:23
                                    As the Son of God, Jesus had access to the power of God
                                    Christ's Sonship was declared by the Holy Spirit
                                        The Members of the Godhead are mutually affirming
                                            Christ sends the Spirit and the Spirit declares Christ
                                    Christ's Sonship was declared by His resurrection from the dead
                                        Death has not power over the Creator of life
                                Jesus is our Lord
                                    Our allegiance and our obedience must be to Him
                                Jesus is Christ
                                    He is the annointed one of God who brings salvation to His people
                                The apostles received grace and apostleship through Jesus
                                    Christ, through His sacrificed, offered them salvific grace to ransom them from sin
                                    Christ sent them out as apostles to tell the world of His grace
                                        This apostleship brings about the obedience of faith
                                            Obedience comes only through faith
                                            The apostles' message pushes people towards faith in Christ
                                                This faith leads to obedience in acknowledgement of His Lordship
                                                    This faith and obedience has the purpose of glorifying the name of Jesus
                                        The call of apostleship sent the gospel out to all nations
                                            All nations are in need of the grace of God
                                            God deserves the worship of all nations
                                            This spread of the gospel brought it to Rome
                                                The Roman believers were called to belong to Christ
            7
                Paul wrote all Christians in Rome
                    The Roman believers were loved by God
                    The Roman believers were called to be saints
                        God called them before they chose Him
                Paul wished his readers to have grace and peace from the Father and Son
                    Grace
                        Good will, loving-kindness, favour of the merciful kindness
                    Peace
                        The tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and content with its earthly lot
                    From God the Father and from Jesus
                        Grace and peace are acquired through the redemptive process which is
                            Commissioned by the Father
                            Executed by the Son
    Interpretaion
        Paul, called to be a servant and apostle of Christ, wrote to Romans who were reached by the gospel of God and called to belong to Christ
    Application
        Submit to God because He owns me

            Paul thanks God for the Romans
                Paul's thanks goes through Christ the intercessor
                The reason for Paul's thankfulness is the proclamation of the Romans' faith
                    Their faith is proclaimed in all the world
        9, 10
            Paul prayed for the Romans
                God bears witness to Paul's prayers
                    God hears Paul's prayers
                    Paul served God
                        With his spirit
                            He didn't just go through motions
                        In the gospel of His Son
                            Paul's service to God was in the context of the gospel
                Paul's prayers for the Romans were constant
                    Without ceasing
                    Always
                Paul prayed that, by God's will, he might succeed in coming to Rome.
                    Somehow
                        Paul did not know the means of his arrival at Rome
                            He trusted God with the details
                                The details involved imprisonment and shipwreck (see Acts)
                    By God's will
                        Paul itinerary was entirely dependent upon God's will
                    Might succeed
                        Paul had tried to go to Rome before but had been prevented from doing so.
        11, 12
            Paul longed to see the Romans
                Paul wanted to impart some spiritual gift to strengthen them
                    Specifically, he wanted to himself and the Romans to be mutually encouraged by each other's faith
                        The Romans could be encouraged by Paul's faith
                        Paul could be encouraged by the Romans' faith
                            The Romans' faith was strong enough to be an encouragement to Paul
        13
            Paul had intended to visit the Romans
                He wanted the Romans to know this
                    Paul was transparent about his itinerary
                Paul was repeatedly prevented from coming to the Romans
                    He was prevented so that he might minister among the rest of the gentiles
                        Specifically he says reap some harvest
                            Remminiscent of John 4:31-38
                        But he would still minister among the Romans
            Paul calls the Romans brothers
                They are his brothers in Christ
        14
            Paul is obligated to everyone
                His obligation is from God to bring the gospel to everyone
                To both Greeks and barbarians
                    Regardless of ethnicity or culture
                To both the wise and the foolish
                    Regardless of wisdom or lack-thereof
                Nobody is beyond the reach of God's grace
        15
            Paul is eager to preach the gospel in Rome
                Even the faithful Romans still needed the gospel preached to them
                    Everyone needs the gospel preached to them
                        Not just initial salvation, but a continual walk
                Paul's universal call to ministry included the Romans
    Interpretation
        Paul thanked God for the faithful witness of the Romans and longed to visit them to strengthen them and spread the gospel
    Application
        Minister to everyone, regardless of social classes or cultures
        Pray for other believers
        Pray more
        Strength is found in fellowship with other believers
