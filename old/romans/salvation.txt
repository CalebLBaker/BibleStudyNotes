Romans 3:21 - 5:21

Romans outline
	ROMANS:	God sovereignly saves sinners through faith and protects them with His love so that they might live to glorify Him
    	Paul wrote to the faithful Romans and desired to visit them and spread further the gospel that had changed them (1:1-15)
		The gospel (1:16 - 15:12)
			Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe (1:16, 17)
			Paul gives a thorough outline of sound doctrine and God's redemptive plan (1:16-11:36)
				The righteousness of God is revealed in the law to condemn all men for breaking the law (1:18 - 3:20)
				We can rejoice in God because His grace overcomes our sin so that His righteousness is counted to us by faith in Jesus apart from the law (3:21 - 5:21)
					God reveals His righteousness in Christ by atoning for sin so that His righteousness can by justly accounted to all who have faith in Jesus (3:21-26)
					Nobody, not even Abraham, can boast in salvation, because it is guarenteed through faith, rather than through works (3:27 - 4:25)
						Boasting is excluded because we are justified and the law is estabished through faith, rather than works (3:27-31)
						Abraham could not boast because God's promised justification was guarenteed to him and his offspring through faith rather than through works (4)
							Even Abraham could not boast because he was justified and forgiven by faith as gift and not by works (4:1-8)
							Since Abraham was justified before he was circumcised, he is the father of all, both circumcised and uncircumcised, who are saved by faith (4:9-12)
							God's promise to Abraham was guarenteed to all of his spiritual offspring through faith and not through works (4:13-25)
								God's promise to Abraham was based on faith and it would have been void if it had been based on works (4:13-15)
								God's promises to Abraham are guarenteed to his spiritual offspring through faith in the God who gives life to the dead (4:16-25)
					Because God, through Christ, has justified and reconciled  us, we can rejoice in God's glory, our suffering, and God Himself (5:1-11)
						Because we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God and can rejoice in our suffering (5:1-5)
						We can rejoice in God Himself because, while we were His enemies, Christ died to reconcile us to Him and to save us (5:6-11)
					Adam's transgression brought sin to all who are in him, but Christ's sacrifice brought grace, justification, and life to all who are in Him
						Sin came through the transgression of Adam and brough death to all mankind because all sinned (5:12-14)
						Christ's gift is not like Adam's trespass (5:15-17)
						Adam's transgression brought a reign of sin and death upon the world, but Christ's grace overcomes sin and death to bring about a rule of righteousness and life (5:18-21)
				Sanctification - the righteous shall live by faith(6, 7)
				Security - power of God (8)
				Sovereignty - to the Jew first and also to the Greek (9-11)
			Paul describes how believers should act in response to the mercy of God - not ashamed of the gospel (12:1 - 15:12)
		Personal letter to the Romans (15:13-16:27)

3:21, 22a

	But now the righteousness of God has been manifested
		apart from the law
			although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it
		the righteousness of God
			through faith
				in Jesus Christ
			for all who believe

	Observations
		But now
			This new section is put in direct contrast to the previous section
			The law has always manifested the righteousness of God
				But no human being was ever justified by it
			But now, God's righteousness is manifested apart from the law
		The righteousness of God has been manifested
			It has been revealed that God is righteous
			Christ is the incarnate manifestation of God's righteousness
		Apart from the law
			The law reveals God's righteousness by condemning the wicked
				Which is everyone
			Now God's righteousness is manifested in a completely different way that is not dependent upon the law
				A person rather than a written code
				Salvation rather than condemnation
					But sin is still punished
					God is still righteous
				The righteousness of God is now manifested more perfectly through Christ than it was through the law
		Although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it
			The entirity of scripture is focused upon Christ
				Not just the New Testament
			The Old Testament can be properly read and interpretted throught the lense of Christ
				Everything in it points to Christ
		The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe
			The righteousness of God is specifically manifested for all who believe
				This is a more profound manifestation than before
					The righteousness of God was manifested TO the hearers of the law
					The righteousness of God is now minifested FOR all who believe
					The law let people see it, Christ lets people have it
			The means of this manifestation is through faith in Jesus Christ
				We have faith in Jesus Christ
				Through that faith, the righteousness of God is manifested on our behalf
			Every person, both the Jew and the Greek, who believes in Christ has the righteousness of God accounted to them
	Summary
		The righteousness of God is manifested in Christ for all who believe
	Application
		Be humble regarding my salvation
			The righteousness that I have is not my own. It is God's.
		Be thankful for my salvation.
			I am saved only because God chose to, through Christ, manifest His righteousness in me
			I am not justified through the law or my own works
				That would be impossible
		Look for Christ when reading the Old Testament
			The Law and Prophets bear witness to the new manifestation of God's righteousness
		Be confident in my salvation
			I have the righteousness of God. I cannot be condemned.

3:22b-25a

	For there is no distinction
		For all
			have sinned
				and fall short
					of the glory of God
			and are justified
				by His grace
				as a gift
				through the redemption
					that is in Christ Jesus
						whom God put forward
							as a propitiation
								by His blood
								to be received
									by faith

	Observations
		For there is no distinction
			All people, both Jew and Greek, both slave and free are on equal footing before God
			All who believe are saved, regardless of any other factors
			All have sinned and stand worthy of condemnation
			Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all	Colossians 3:11
		For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
			This is a restatement of the point of 1:18 - 3:20
			There has never been a single person anywhere at any time who has, through his own righteousness, been right before God
			God's glory is a high and perfect standard
				No human can meet it of their own power
			Why is it God's glory that they have fallen short of?
				All have sinned and fallen short of God's righteous standard
				God is glorified through His righteousness
					Therefore, by falling short of His righteousness they fall short of His glory
		And are justified
			Declared righteous before God
			Are all justified?
				Qualifier comes in verse 25
					All who receive Christ by faith are justified
		by His grace as a gift
			All those who are justified are justified by His grace
				It is not their righteousness that justifies them
					God graciously gives them His righteousness as a gift
						It is His righteousness
							He gives it to whom He pleases
						God is gracious in giving His righteousness to others as a gift when they don't deserve it
						God is a righteous judge
							He must condemn those who are not righteous
								No human being is able to achieve righteousness
							He cannot condemn those who are righteous
								God is generous and has an infinite abundance of righteousness
									God can give His righteousness to us
									God cannot condemn those who He gives His own righteousness to
					They receive God's righteousness as a gift
						They did nothing to earn it
					If they were justified by their own righteousness, they would be a slave to the law
						The one who does the commandments shall live by them
						Any infraction against the law or sin would cause them to lose their righteousness
					Since they are justified by God's righteousness, they cannot lose what is not based in them
						Their sinning cannot break God's righteousness
						The righteousness they have is in no way dependent upon them
						The righteousness they have cannot be lost or taken away
		through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
			The means by which God gives His righteousness to people is the redemption that is accomplished in Christ
		whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood
			The penalty of sin is death
			Christ died and His blood payed the penalty of our sin
			With this price, God buys us back to Himself and gives us His own righteousness
				The wrath of God is satisfied because the sin has been payed for
				God is generous in giving His own righteousness to us
					He chooses who He gives it to
				The righteousness of God is satisfied because we, who are now righteous, are not condemned
		to be received by faith
			Faith is the mechanism by which we receive God's righteousness
			As it is written, "The righteous shall live be faith"				Romans 1:17 quoting Habbakuk 2:4
			Without faith it is impossible to please God	 					Hebrews 11:6
				Without faith, we cannot receive the righteousness of God
					Without faith, we must be condemned
				By faith, we receive the righteousness of God
					With faith, we cannot be condemned
	Summary
		All men have sinned against God and deserve condemnation, but God gives His own righteousness to all who receive Christ by faith
	Application
		By faith, I have the righteousness of God

2:25b, 26
	This was to show God's righteousness
		because in His divine forbearance
			He had passed over former sins
	It was to show His righteousness at the present time
		so that He might be
			just
			and the justifier
				of the one who has faith in Jesus
	Observations
		25b
			The reason that God put Christ forward as a propitiation was to show His righteousness
				The reason this was necessary was because God had passed over former sins
			God is righteous, therefore, He must punish all sins
				If a sin is passed over, then there must be a propitiation to pay the penalty for it
			His divine forbearance
				Because He is God, God knows which sins will be atoned for in Christ and so He withheld His wrath on those sins, knowing it was satisfied in Christ
		26
			Christ's sacrifice shows God's righteousness in the present time
				When is the present time?
					Probably the church age
			How does Christ's sacrifice show God's righteousness?
				It shows that He does not allow sin to go unpunished
			Christ's sacrifice is what allows God to be both just and the justifier of those who have faith in Jesus
				What do we know about those who have faith in Jesus?
					We are sinners
					Sinners are unrighteous
				A just judge does not justify the unrighteous
					Because Christ's sacrifice pays the penalty for our sin, God can remain just while accounting His own righteousness to us and thereby justifying those who have faith in Christ.
			Justify
				Declare righteous
		Summary
			Christ's sacrifice paid the penalty for sins so that God could remain just while justifying those who have faith in Christ
		Application
			Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift!

3:21-26 summary
	God reveals His righteousness in Christ by atoning for sin so that His righteousness can by justly accounted to all who have faith in Jesus

3:27-31
	3:27
		Observations
			Paul, as a Jew, asks a natural question
				Then what becomes of our boasting?
				The Jews have long boasted in the Law that they have from God
					Through that Law, the Jews have seen fit to boast in God Himself
			Paul answers his own question
				It is excluded
					Since our righteousness is not our own, but rather God's, we have no grounds for boasting
					Jews cannot boast in the Law because their righteousness cannot come from the Law
			Paul asks how the boasting can be excluded
				By what kind of law?
			Paul suggests a bad answer to his question
				By a laaw of works?
			Paul gives the correct answer to his question
				No, but by the law of faith
				A law of works cannot exclude boasting
					If righteousness were achieved by a law of works we would have every right to boast in the works we have done to earn our righteousness
						But by works of the law no human being will be justified in His sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin
				It is by the law of faith that we are made righteous
					This is the law of faith: we believe God and it is credited to us as righteousness
					Where does this faith come from?
						Does it come from us that we might boast in it?
							No, it is a gift from from God
							For by grace you hae been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.	Ephesians 2:8, 9
					We are saved because God's righteousness is credited to us by means of the faith that God gave us as a gift
						We contributed nothing to that process, therefore we have nothing of which we may boast
		Summary
			The boasting of the Jews is excluded because men are saved by God's righteousness through faith and not their own righteousness through works
		Application
			Remember that my faith and righteousness are not my own, they are gifts from God
			Do not boast in my salvation
			Do not boast in what I see as my good works
			Be humble

	3:28
		For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law
		Observations
			Who is we?
				Paul and those who are with him in Corinth writing the letter?
				The Church as a whole?
			One is justified by faith
				Justified
					God's righteousness is accounted to another so that they might be just before God
				By faith
					Trusting in Christ and the redemption that took place at the cross
			Apart from works of the law
				By works of the law no human being will be justified in His sight
				No part of salvation is accomplished by the law
		Summary
			Paul and his companions held that a man is justified by faith, which has nothing to do with works of the law
		Application
			Trust in Christ for justification
			Have confidence
				My salvation is rooted in Christ, who is infallible, and not in myself
			Don't try to earn justification by works of the law
	3:29, 30
		Observations
			God is the sovereign Lord over all people
				Both Jews and Gentiles
			God cares for and offers salvation to all people
				If salvation came through works of the law, then God could be considered the God of Jews only since the law was given to the Jews
				Salvation, however, comes through faith and faith is given to to Jews only, but also to Gentiles
			Jews and Gentiles alike are both justified through faith
				Justification does not come from circumcision or from uncircumcision
			God is one
				There is no other God.
				The same God who justifies the circumcised Jews through faith also justifies the uncircumcised Gentiles through faith
			The only means of justification is faith
		Summary
			God, as the God of both Jews and Gentiles, saves both Jews and Gentiles through faith.
		Application
			Faith is the only means through which we can be justified in God's sight
			God is the God of everyone and so anyone who has faith can be justified.
	3:31
		Observations
			Faith does not overthrow the law
			Faith upholds the law
			While everything said in the previous verses is true, this does not mean that faith overthrows the law
		Summary
			Rather than overthrowing the law, faith upholds the law
		Application
			The Old Testament is still valid and worth studying
			The Old Testament still teaches us about God
	Summary
		Boasting is excluded because we are saved and the law is estabished through faith, rather than works


God created a perfect universe, which was cursed by the sin of man, but God called out Abraham to bless the wourle through his offspring (Genesis)
	From the line of Shem, God called out Abraham and promised to use his offspring to bless all the nations of the earth (11:10 - 50:26)
		God called Abraham, blessed him and his descendents, and promised to bring from him a great nation that would be a blessing to all the earth (11:27 - 50:26)
			God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:18)
				God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:11)
					Twice God promised to bless Abraham's descendants and, although Abraham attempted to take matters into his own hands, he believed and God provided (15 - 21)
						God promised to make a nation from the descendants of Abram and Abram believed, but took matters into his own hands by having a child with Hagar (15, 16)
							God promised to make Abram's descendants into a nation which would possess Canaan (15)
								God promised to give Abram many descendants and Abram believed in God's promise (15:1-6)
									Abram believed in God's promise of descendants and this belief was counted to him as righteousness (15:6)

4:1-8
	4:1-3
		Observations
			1
				Paul is using Abraham as an example to illustrate the point that he made in 3:27-31
				Paul asked what Abraham gained according to the flesh
				The flesh has to do with works and circumcision
				If Abraham gained from works and cicumcision, then Paul's point from the previous paragraph is weakened
					If Abraham gained salvation through works, then he has much to boast about and Paul's argument is completely dismantled
			2
				If Abraham was justified by works
					He has something to boast about
					Boasting is not excluded
					Salvation is accomplished and the law is established through works, rather than faith
					Even so, while Abraham could have boasted before men he could not have boasted before God
						Whether God saved Abraham through Abraham's works or through faith, it is still God who saved Abraham
							Therefore, Abraham has nothing to boast of before God
			3
				Paul consults the Old Testament to answer whether Abraham was saved for his works
					Genesis clearly says that Abraham believed God and that belief was counted as righteousness
					Belief come through faith, not works
					Therefore, Abraham was declared righteous because of his faith and not because of his works
					Righteousness comes through faith that God will keep His promises
		Summary
			Abraham was justified by faith, and could not boast of justification by works
		Application
			Salvation comes through faith and not through works
			I have nothing to boast of regarding my own salvation
	4:4-8
		Observations
			4
				Those who work deserve what they are given
				If you worked for something, then it cannot be considered a gift
				Paul made it clear in 3:24 that justification is a gift from God
			5
				God justifies the ungodly
				Righteousness is given as a gift to those who believe in God and believe that He justifies the ungodly
				Those who receive righteousness did not work for it
			6-8
				Paul cites David, who talked about the blessing of those who recieve righteousness as a gift
				God forgives the lawless deeds of the ungodly who trust in Him
				God covers the sins of those who trust in Him and will not count their sins against them
				This forgiveness and the accompanying righteousness are a wonderful blessing and a gift
				The works of the blessed did not earn their righteousness
					The work they did was lawless deeds that needed to be forgiven
					The granting of righteousness involves and requires a forgiveness of sins
		Summary
			To those who believe in Him, God counts righteousness as a gift and not as a result of works
		Application
			Do not boast in salvation
			Believe in God and trust in Him
			Be grateful for the salvation you have received as a gift and not as a result of works
	Summary
		Even Abraham could not boast because he was justified and forgiven by faith as gift and not by works

Those who trust God with their sin will be forgiven and blessed (Psalm 32)
	Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven (1, 2)

4:9-12
	4:9, 10
		Observations
			9
				Both Abraham and David were justified by faith apart from works
				Both Abraham and David were circumcised
				Clearly justification by faith is available to the circumcised
				Paul asks whether justification by faith is available to the uncircumcised
			10
				We now look closer at the example of Abraham
					How was Abraham's faith counted as righteousness?
						More specifically, when?
							Before or after circumcision?
								It was not after, but before
				If his faith was credited to him as righteousness before he was circumcised, then this justification could not have been dependent upon his circumcision
				Therefore, justification by faith as a gift from God must be available to the uncircumcised.
				If circumcision is not necessary for salvation, then what's the point of circumcision?
					That will be answered in the next few verses.
		Summary
			Since Abraham was justified before he was circumcised, justification by faith must be available to both the circumcised and the uncircumcised
		Application
			I don't need to get circumcised.
			When I have children, I don't need to get them circumcised.
			Physical signs can represent spiritual realities, but physical signs to not cause spiritual realities.
				Further, spiritual realities are not dependent upon physical signs.
	4:11, 12
		Observations
			11a
				Circumcision is a sign
					The purpose of circumcision is to point to something else
				Abraham's circumcision served to signify and ratify the righteousness that he already had
				The spiritual reality of Abraham's righteousness was true by faith before God gave him a physical sign to represent it
				Circumcision is a physical sign that points to and reflects the spiritual reality of justification by faith
			11b
				Abraham was declared righteous before he was circumcised so that he could be counted as the spiritual father of those who believe without being circmcised.
				We are, by faith, chilren of the covenant that God established with Abraham millenia ago
				We must be children of the Abrahamic covenant in order for righteousness to be accounted to us.
				The Jews counted Abraham as the spiritual father of the circumcised.
					They are right that he is the spiritual father of those who are circumcised and believe
						But this is not merely because they are circumcised, but rather because they live by the same faith that Abraham lived by.
						Since Abraham had this faith even before he was circumcised, it is the faith that makes them children of Abraham rather than the circumcision.
							The Abrahamic covenant was based on faith and not on circumcision
								Although circumcision is a sign of the Abrahamic covenant
		Summary
			Circumcision was only a sign of the righteousness that Abraham already had; true children of Abraham are those who continue in that same faith.
		Application
			I am a child of Abraham
			Sacrements serve as signs and seals of the faith we already have; they do not give righteousness
			I am saved by faith
	Summary
		Since Abraham was justified before he was circumcised, he is the father of all, both circumcised and uncircumcised, who are saved by faith
4:13-15
	Observations
		13
			God made a promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world
				What is this promise?
					By you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed?
					We are co-heirs with Christ
					Christ, as the offspring of Abraham, will inherit all of creation
				This promise did not come through the law
					The law had not been given yet at the time that this promise was made
				This promise came through the righteousness of faith
					Abraham needed to be righteous in order for the promise to be fulfilled
					Abraham's faith in the promise and in God gave him the righteousness that he needed
		14
			What would be the result if the promise had come through the law
				Then faith is not needed
					The promise is achieved through doing the works of the law
				If fulfilling the law is the only way to achieve the promise, then it is not a very useful promise
					Nobody can achieve righteousness by the law
					If it is dependent upon achieving righteousness through the law, then it is conditional
						If it is conditional, then it is not really a promise
		15
			The law does not bring righteousness
				It brings wrath
					See 1:18-3:20
			Where there is no law, there is no transgression
				Man cannot willfully violate the law if there is no law to willfully violate
			Rather than bringing righteousness, the law brings condemnation to those who trangress its commandments
	Summary
		God's promise to Abraham was based on faith and it would have been void if it had been based on works
	Application
		Don't rely on my own righteousness
			I don't have any
		Rely on God's righteousness that is given through faith

God created a perfect universe, which was cursed by the sin of man, but God called out Abraham to bless the wourle through his offspring (Genesis)
	From the line of Shem, God called out Abraham and promised to use his offspring to bless all the nations of the earth (11:10 - 50:26)
		God called Abraham, blessed him and his descendents, and promised to bring from him a great nation that would be a blessing to all the earth (11:27 - 50:26)
			God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:18)
				God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:11)
					Twice God promised to bless Abraham's descendants and, although Abraham attempted to take matters into his own hands, he believed and God provided (15 - 21)
						God promised to bless the earth through Abraham's descendants and blessed Abraham with a son in his old age (17 - 21)
							God remembered Abraham by rescuing Lot and He promised to remember Abraham by giving him a son who would bring a blessing to all the earth (17 - 19)
								God established the covenant of circumcision with Abraham and promised to give him a nation of offspring through Sarah (17)
									God established the covenant of circumcision with Abraham and promised to give him the land of Canaan and a nation of offspring (17:1-14)
										God promised to multiply Abraham's offspring into a multitude of nations and to give the land of Canaan to them (17:1-8)
											God promised to make Abraham the father of a multitude of nations (17:4)
4:16-25
	4:16, 17
		Observations
			Because the law brings wrath, God's promise to Abraham must depend upon something outside of the law
			God promised to be God to Abraham's offspring (Genesis 17:8)
				If this promise depends on the flesh or on the law, then it cannot be guarenteed to all of Abraham's offspring
			God's promise rests on grace
				He has mercy on whom He has mercy
				He has no obligation to give His blessing to the physical descendants of Abraham
			God's promise is guaranteed to all of Abraham's offspring
				But this is not talking about physical offspring
					"If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works that Abraham did." - John 8:39
				It is not to physical descendants of Abraham who receive the promise, but the spiritual descendants of Abraham
					This is the point that Paul was making in 4:11, 12
						"walk in the footsteps of faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised."
			Not only to the adherants of the law
				This seems to insinuate that the promise is applied to those who adhere to the law
					But nobody truly adheres to the law
			But also to the one who shares in the faith of Abraham
				God's promises to Abraham apply to all those who follow in the faith that Abraham had
					i.e. the church
			Who is the father of us all
				"us all" probably refers to all believers and not to all mankind
				Jesus, at least, didn't seem to act like unbelievers were children of Abraham
			"I have made you the father of a multitude of nations"
				On the surface this promise seems to refer to the nations physically descended from Abraham
					Arab nations descended from Ishmael
					Edom 
					Israel
				In actuality it is refering to all the nations that contain people who follow in the same faith that Abraham had
					Any nation where any believer has ever lived
			That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guarenteed to all his offspring in the presence of God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
			The guarentee of the promise is accomplished in the presence of God
				Further, it is accomplished by God and would be impossible without God
				Abraham believed God
					This was the source of his righteousness
				God gives life to the dead
					He gives spiritual life to the spiritually dead and makes them children of Abraham
				God calls into existence the things that do not exist
					God calls into existence a multitude of nations of offspring for Abraham
					God calls into existence a holy nation and royal priesthood for Himself
		Summary
			God's promise to Abraham depends on faith in order that it may be guarenteed to all of the spiritual offspring of Abraham
		Application
			Trust in God's promises
				They apply even more to me as Abraham's spiritual descendant than they do to his physical descendants
			Believe in God
			Follow in the same faith that Abraham had
	
God created a perfect universe, which was cursed by the sin of man, but God called out Abraham to bless the wourle through his offspring (Genesis)
	From the line of Shem, God called out Abraham and promised to use his offspring to bless all the nations of the earth (11:10 - 50:26)
		God called Abraham, blessed him and his descendents, and promised to bring from him a great nation that would be a blessing to all the earth (11:27 - 50:26)
			God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:18)
				God called Abraham, increased his faith, and promised to bless all the earth through his offspring (11:27 - 25:11)
					Twice God promised to bless Abraham's descendants and, although Abraham attempted to take matters into his own hands, he believed and God provided (15 - 21)
						God promised to make a nation from the descendants of Abram and Abram believed, but took matters into his own hands by having a child with Hagar (15, 16)
							God promised to make Abram's descendants into a nation which would possess Canaan (15)
								God promised to give Abram many descendants and Abram believed in God's promise (15:1-6)
									God promised Abram that his offspring would be as numerous as the stars (15:5)
	4:18
		Observations
			Abram had hope and believed that God would make him the father of many nations
				"in hope he believed against hope"
					He had hope in something that seemed impossible
						But nothing is impossible with God
			God had told Abram that he would father many nations
				God had told Abram that his offspring would be as numerous as the stars
					A people as numerous as the stars would be easiliy numerous enough to comprise a multitude of nations
			God told Abram what to believe
			God keeps His promises, therefore, believing in them is not foolish
		Summary
			Despite the seeming impossibility of it, Abram believed God's promise that he would become the father of a multitude of nations
		Application
			Trust God's promises even when they seem unlikely
			God keeps His promises

	4:19-21
		Observations
			4:19
				Abraham's faith was not weakened when he considered the impossibility of conceiving offspring
					His own body was as good as dead
						God brought life (Isaac) from death (Abraham's body and Sarah's womb)
						He was 100 years old
						Hundred year old men don't have children
					Sarah's womb was barren
						Barren women don't bear children
					Any child that Abraham and Sarah had would have been a miracle
					Abraham believed that God would work a reproductive miracle through him and Sarah
			4:20, 21
				Abraham did not entertain any unbelief regarding God's promise
					No unbelief made him waver
						This can be said of him despite the Hagar incident
				Instead, he grew strong in his faith
					This happened as he gave glory to God
					Paul might mean to imply that Abraham's faith was strengthened because he gave glory to God
				The reason Abraham gave glory to God is because He was fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised
					What God had promised seemed impossible
					Therefore, God must be able to do the impossible
						We already know this to be the case from other scripture
				God receives glory for being able to do what He promises
				Not only is God able to do what He promises, but He actually does it
		Summary
			Abraham's faith was strengthened by his belief in God, rather than being weakened by seemingly impossible circumstances
		Application
			Faith is strengthened through trusting God in impossible circumstances
			Times of waiting build faith
			God is able to do that which He promises to do
			Faith is strengthened by glorifying God
	4:22-25
		Observations
			22
				Abraham's faith was counted to him as righteousness
					Abraham believed God
						Specifically, he believed that God was able to do that which He had promised
					Because Abraham believed God, his faith was strengthened, as opposed to being weakened by seemingly impossible circumstances
					Because Abraham's faith was strenthened, it was counted to him as righteousness
			23-25
				The words "it was counted to him" were not written for Abraham's sake alone
					We also can have our faith counted to us as righteousness
				Abraham was justified by his faith that God would keep His promises
				We are justified by our faith that God has kept His promises
					We have faith that God delivered Jesus up to pay the penalty for our trespasses
					We have faith that God raised Jesus up to seal our justification
				We are justified by the death and resurection of Jesus Christ, and our faith in that justification is counted to us as righteousness
		Summary
			Just as Abraham's faith in God's promise was counted as righteousness, so our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is counted to us as righteousness
		Application
			Old Testament concepts can often be directly applied to believers
			We are justified by faith and not by works
			Our faith is strengthened when we believe in God despite difficult circumstances
	Summary
		God's promises to Abraham are guarenteed to his spiritual offspring through faith in the God who gives life to the dead

5:1-5
	5:1, 2
		Observations
			5:1
				We have been justified by faith
					This has been well established in the last couple chapters
				Because we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God
					When we were unjustified, we were actively in rebellion against Him
					Because we are justified, we are no longer bound by our sin
						We are, therefore, no longer in the open rebellion against God that sin demands
				Justification by faith means freedom from sin, which causes peace with God
				This peace comes through our Lord Jesus Christ
					He is the One who brought us justification
					He is our Lord because we must submit to His will
						We submit to His will because our rebellion against Him is over
			5:2
				This verse is explaining how it is that our peace with God comes through our Lord Jesus Christ
				Through Him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand
					We stand in grace
						We're sinners before a holy God; grace is the only way we can stand
						We access this grace by faith
							This is mirroring the "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness" theme of chapter 4
							It must be by faith, "for by works of the law, no human being will be justified in His sight"
							This faith, by which we obtain access to grace, must be in Jesus
								He is the One who paid the penalty for our sin so that we could receive grace
								He is the One who advocated on our behalf before God
				and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God
					Because of the justification that we have in Jesus, we have hope
						What does it mean that it is a "hope of the glory of God"
							Perhaps Paul is referring to the hope that we will one day be perfected and glorified.
								Once perfected and glorified, we will be able to more perfectly and more fully give glory to God
					We can rejoice in this hope that we have in Christ
		Summary
			Because we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God and access to grace and hope through Jesus Christ
		Application
			I am at peace with God
			I stand only through grace, which I access only through faith in Christ
				So I should be grateful for the access that I have to this grace
			I should live in hope as a result of my justification through faith in Christ
	5:3-5
		Observations
			We rejoice in our sufferings
				This seems like a strange statement, so Paul uses the rest of the paragraph to explain how this can be the case
				Suffering produces endurance
				Endurance produces character
					What exactly does character mean?
						Proven character
						Character that remains virtuous through trials
				Character produces hope
				Hope does not put us to shame
					That which we hope for will be realized
					Because God's love has been poured into our hearts
						This is something worth hoping in
						God will care for those whom He loves
					Through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us
						The ministry of the Holy Spirit is how God continues to show His love for us
						Since the Holy Spirit is inside of us, God is inside of us
						Since God is inside of us, God's love is inside of us
						The Holy Spirit is a seal of the hope that we have in Christ
			Our suffering causes us to have proven character and hope that is founded in the love of God and the Holy Spirit
		Summary
			We can rejoice in our trials because they ultimatlely produce hope in God's love through the Holy Spirit
		Application
			I should rejoice in the patience that I am learning through long distance relationships
	Summary
		Because we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God and can rejoice in our suffering

5:6-11
	5:6
		Observations
			While we were still weak
				We were weak when we were in sin
				We are not weak anymore
					We have strength from God
						On our own, we would still be weak
				Though we had made ourselves into God's enemies, we were no threat to Him
				We had nothing to offer God
			At the right time
				The time at which Christ died was the right time for Him to die
				What does it mean that it was the right time
					The Roman Empire gave the stability necessary for the gospel to quickly spread across large parts of the world?
					The Jews had achieved great heights of both desire for God's Messiah and rebellion against God?
						The Jewish religious system had become corrupt and needed correcting
					It was the time that God had chosen for it to happen and His reasoning and planning is beyond our comprehension.
			Christ died for the ungodly
				Christ was the most godly man ever
					He was God
				We were ungodly and in no way deserving of Christ's sacrifice
				Christ's sacrifice caused us to become godly, although we were ungodly at the time that it happened
			Christ's sacrifice had nothing to do with our merit, because we had none
			Christ's sacrifice demonstrates God's love by paying the price of our rebellion and, thereby, achieving several benefits for us
				We have peace with God
				We have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand
				We rejoice in hope of the glory of God
				We rejoice in our sufferings
		Summary
			For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
		Application
			Gratitude and humility
				We did nothing to merit Christ's gracious sacrifice for us
	5:7, 8
		Observations
			Paul is contrasting God's love with human love
			7
				One will scarcely die for a righteous person
					Humans would barely be willing to lay down their lives for someone who is righteous and deserves such sacrifice
				Perhaps, for a good person one would dare even to die
					If it was a good person in need of the sacrifice, then maybe a particularly brave person might be willing to die for them
				People generally aren't willing to die for other people
				It would be considered an act of extraordinary bravery and love to sacrifice your life for the sake of a good person
			8
				God's love is greater than human love
				While humans would be reluctant to sacrifice, even for a good person, God makes sacrifices for sinners
				We were not good people.
					No one should have even considered sacrificing their life for us
				Christ's death demonstrates God's love
					Christ is God, so if Christ died for us then God died for us
				We were still sinners
					We deserved wrath, not love
				Christ died for us
					Christ loved us enough to make the ultimate sacrifice for us when we did not deserve it
		Summary
			Though men scarcely have enough love to die for the righteous, God's love was demonstrated by Christ dying for sinner
		Application
			Love should come with a willingness to sacrifice
			Love is not dependent upon merit
	5:9, 10
		Observations
			9
				Because Christ died for us, we have been justified by His blood
				Because we have been justified by His blood, He will save us from the wrath of God
					Because of our sin, we deserve God's wrath and need to be saved
					Because we have been justified, we are no longer deserving of God's wrath, so Christ is justified in saving us from that wrath
			10
				We were once enemies of God
				While we were God's enemies, He loved us enough to send His son to die in order to reconcile us to Him
				Because of Christ's death, we are no longer enemies of God
				Now that we are reconciled, Christ's life brings us salvation
		Summary
			If Christ died to justify us while we were still enemies of God, then He will surely live to save us now that we have been reconciled to God
		Application 
			For those who are in Christ, there is no reason to fear the wrath of God
			Those who are in Christ should be grateful for the justification, reconciliation, and salvation that they have received
	5:11
		Observations
			Not only are we saved from God's wrath, but we can rejoice in Him
			The channel through which we can rejoice in God is Jesus Christ
			The reason we can rejoice in God through Jesus Christ is because we received reconciliation through Jesus Christ
			Paul uses the word received
				This shows that our reconciliation was a gift and we did not do anything to bring about our reconciliation with God
			The ultimate result of the sacrificial divine love that is talked about in verses 6-11 is that we, who were once under God's wrath, can now rejoice in God
			This verse ties back to verses 2 and 4
				We rejoice in hope of the glory of God,	(verse 2)
				and we rejoice in our sufferings, 		(verse 4)
				more than that, we also rejoice in God	(verse 11)
		Summary
			We rejoice not only in God's glory and our suffering, but also in God Himself through Jesus Christ and the reconciliation we have through Him.
		Application
			Rejoice in God
			Rejoice in God through Jesus Christ
			Be prompted to rejoice in God by meditating on the reconciliation that was accomplished by Jesus
	Summary
		We can rejoice in God Himself because, while we were His enemies, Christ died to reconcile us to Him and to save us

5:12-14
	5:12, 13
		Observations
			What is the therefore there for?
				The contents of this paragraph are present as following from our justification by faith
			Just as
				Paul is going to draw a comparison between two events
					The fall and redemption
					The redemption part of the comparison won't come until the next paragraph
			Sin came into the world through one man
				Adam's original sin brought sin into the world
				All of our rebellion against God can be traced back to Adam's disregard of God's law regarding the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
				Just as sin came into the world through the one man Adam, justification came into the world through the one man Christ
			And death through sin
				Death is the natural result of sin
					Sin is a rejection of God
					Jesus is God and Jesus is life
					Therefore, sin is a rejection of life
				Just as death came through sin, life came through justification
			Death spread to all men because all sinned
				Just as death spread to all men who sinned, life spread to all men who are justified by faith
			Every human being to ever live, except Jesus, has continued in the sin and rebellion of Adam
			Therefore, every human has rejected life and experienced death
			Sin was in the world before the law was given
				The law was given to Moses, but sin enterred the world through Adam throusands of years earlier
				Just as sin was in the world before the law was given, justification and redemption were in the world before Christ died
					Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness
			Sin is not counted where there is no law
				I don't know what to do with this one
				Probably saying that sin is not counted as transgression where there is no law
		Summary
			Sin and death came into the world through the sin of one man, but spread to all because all sinned
		Application
			Believe the doctrine of total depravity
	5:14
		Observations
			Yet
				The contents of this verse are true despite sin not being counted when there is no law
			Death reigned from Adam to Moses
				Death came into the world through Adam's sin
				Even without the law of Moses to break, sin still brought death and death still reigned
				It could be more complete to say that death reigned from Adam to Christ
					But the portion of this time before Moses is emphasized to show that there does not need to be a law for sin to break for it to bring death
			Even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam
				The word transgression implies specifically and willfully breaking a law
				The sins of those between Adam and Moses were not transgressions because no law had been given for them to break
				Adam had the specific law not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and so his sin was transgression
				Adam's sin was the original sin from which all other sins come
				Even though their sins were not transgressions and were not the original sin, the sins of those between Adam and Moses still brought death
					Death still reigned over them because they rejected God and, in doing so, rejected life
			Who was a type of the One who was to come
				Adam is a type of Christ
				Adam was perfectly created in the image of God without a sin nature
				The consequences of choices made by Adam affect all of mankind
		Summary
			Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even though there was no law to transgress
		Application
			Sin is still sin even if you didn't break any particular rule you were given
	Summary
		Sin came through the transgression of Adam and brough death to all mankind because all sinned
	Application
		Our circumstance is hopeless without Christ
5:15-17
	5:15
		Observations
			Paul contrasts Christ's accomplishments with Adam's
				Christ gives a free gift; Adam commited a trespass
				Many died through Adam's trespass; many received life through Christ's gift
				The free gift which Christ gave was grace
				Through Christ, the grace of God and the grace of Christ have abounded to many
				The grace of God, through Christ, has abounded much more than sin abounded from Adam's trespass
					The life of grace is greater than the death of sin
					Death only abounded to all because all sinned; grace abounds to those who do nothing to earn it	
		Summary
			Christ's gift is not like Adam's trespass because, while Adam's trespass brough death to many, Christ's gift brought grace to many
		Application
			Thanks be to Christ for His wonderful gift
	5:16, 17
		Observations
			Paul continues contrasting Christ's accomplishments with Adam's
			Paul repeats the form that he used in verse 15
			The free gift is not like the result of the one man's sin
			The result of Adam's sin came after a single trespass
			The result of Christ's gift came after many trespasses
			The judgement of Adam's sin brought condemnation
			Christ's gift brought justification
				Justification undoes condemnation
			Because of Adam's trespass, death reigns through Adam
			Because of Christ's gift, we reign in life through Christ
				Christ is life
					We reign in Christ through Christ because of Christ
			Free gift of righteousness
				Christ's gift is free and brings righteousness
			Those who receive the abundance of grace
				God's grace is abundant; there is plenty for everyone who believes; there is no limit
				Those who receive this abundance are those who believe
		Summary
			Christ's gift is not like Adam's trespass because, while Adam's trespass brough condemnation and a reign of death, Christ's gift brought justification and a reign of life
	Summary
		Christ's gift is not like Adam's trespass
5:18-21
	5:18, 19
		Observations
			Paul switches from contrasting Adam and Jesus to comparing them
			18
				Therefore
					This paragraph continues the comparison/contrast of Adam and Christ that has been maintained through the last two paragraphs
				One trespass leads to condemnation for all men; One act or righteousness leads to justification and life for all men
					The trespass is the sin of Adam in the garden
						It leads to condemnation for all men because in brings sin into the world so that all sin
					The act of righteousness is Christ's death on the cross
						It leads to justification because it pays the penalty for sin
						It leads to life because it allows us to be one with Christ, who is, Himself, life
						This justification and life are made available to all men
			19
				Adam's disobedience caused many to become sinners; Christ's obedience caused many to become righteous
					Adam disobeyed God's command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
						This caused all men to become sinners
					Christ obeyed God's command to redeem mankind through His sacrifice and death on the cross
						This caused faith to be counted as righteousness to all who believe
		Summary
			Just as Adam's unrighteousness brought condemnation to all who are in him, so Christ's righteousness brought righteousness and justification to all who are in Him
	5:20, 21
		Observations
			The law came in to increase the trespass
				Specifically the lame came to elevate sin to the level of trespass
				Where there is no law, there is no trespass, although there can be sin
				Note that Paul says increase and not bring about
				There was sin before the law, but that sin was not trespass since God had not given specific commandments for it to violate
			Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more
				God's grace is greater than our sin
				The result of Christ's sacrifice is greater than the result of Adam's trespass
				Where there is more sin to cover, God's grace abounds to cover more
			As sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
				Sin reigned in death
					Through sin all died such that sin reigned supreme
						The result of this reign was death
					Grace reigned through righteousness
						God's grace abounds to all who accept it and overcomes sin
						The result of this grace is righteousness
							i.e. all who are saved by grace are declared righteous
						Grace is set as the contrast to sin since grace overcomes sin
						Righteousness is set as the contrast to death
							This is because righteousness leads to life
						Righteousness leads to eternal life
							God will not condemn or destroy the righteous
						The righteousness comes through Jesus Christ
							It is Christ's righteousness that is counted to us and not some mythical righteousness of our own
							It is Christ's sacrifice that allows His righteousness to be counted to us.
						Jesus Christ is our Lord
							When grace reigns through righteousness, it is Jesus who is really reigning because Jesus is Lord
			Summary
				The law came to increase the reign of sin and death, but where sin increased grace and righteousness abounded all the more through Jesus Christ
		Summary
			Adam's transgression brought a reign of sin and death upon the world, but Christ's grace overcomes sin and death to bring about a rule of righteousness and life
