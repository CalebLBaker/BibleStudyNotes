	Observations
		For
			These two verses offer an explanation for Paul's eagerness to go to Rome
			These two verses are a good summary of the main themes of the book of Romans
		16
			Paul is not ashamed of the gospel
				In fact, he boldly declares it wherever he goes
				The gospel is the power of God for salvation
					The gospel is the means by which God saves
						It is the only means by which He saves
						God saves everyone who believes
							No ethnic restrictions
							Jew first
								Salvation was offered to the Jews first through God's Old Testament interactions with Israel
							And also to the Greek
								Greek refers to all Gentiles
								The Jewish rejection of their Messiah caused salvation to go out through the whole world
		17
			The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel
				God does pardon sinner
					But it is not willy-nilly
					All sin is paid for in full
				From faith for faith
					The righteousness of God is attained through faith
						God's righteousness is counted towards those who have faith
							Because of this legal reckoning, they are allowed to live
					The rightesouness of God increases faith
					"The righteous shall live by faith"
						The righteous cannot maintain righteousness through their own works
						Righteousness comes only by faith in God
							"And he believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness"
							The righteous do not get glory for their own righteousness, rather God gets all glory from all righteousness
						The righteous are not puffed up in wicked arrogance
							The righteous humbly put their faith in God
						Because of their faith, the righteous will live while the arrogane and wicked will be judged
	Summary
		Paul is not ashamed of the gospel for it is God's saving power to impute His righteousness, by faith, to all who believe
